The human species sleeps, without a calculus for MINDS LOST WITHOUT AN IDENTITY, where the ignorance of our shadows hidden deep within our minds are not limits, but valuable commodities of time, worth more than their weight in gold. Our minds control invaluable resources hidden within the 4th dimension, and if at all, we can unite the TIME of our thoughts to ideas that are greater than all of their shadows, our minds in its Thinking will guide us beyond who we desire to be. There are empirical references in time we all can scale in the 3rd dimension, which we can apply in accuracy to measures of the 4th dimension of our elusive minds. An empirical reference creates an understanding that reflects the physical world, immediately exposing the hidden imposters in our weaknesses, influenced by vocabularies which reinforce their limits over us. Our vocabulary, in whatever dialects they are spoken, are words we use internally to motivate change, but instead of encouraging us, the imperfections in our speech and articulation restrict access to our minds searching to embrace themselves in the inspirations that surround us. Thus, the mind rejects these hindrances, estranging itself from us and imagination, and becomes the unimaginable. The unimaginable is the opposite influence of vocabularies in what we think is impossible, as everything we are not, or can‚Äôt be, as realities beyond our limits we accept as who we are. Whereas the empirical reference of our minds are harmonic languages in imagination, teaching us why we think, where to look and how to SEE, as new opportunities hidden within the words, we speak to ourselves either in comfort or in our mental disparities. Mind ReMapping is a language illuminating an internal identity, so that we no longer need to be afraid of the dark, and nor do we need to be afraid of our minds and what future they will choose for us. If you want to know why we fear the future and the realities the external world holds for us all, it‚Äôs not because we don‚Äôt have the confidence to embrace our greatest choices, it is because our MINDS are LOST WITHOUT AN IDENTITY. If you remove imagination and its means to build an internal image of the self, you remove the cognitive navigations of Will and Influence for that identity to choose and decide clearly.

OÔªøne of the most important roles in a Flamenco performance is that of a Palmero (the hand clapper). YES, you heard correctly! You won't ever see a flamenco show without one or two people in the back clapping their hands. What they are doing is called making Comp√°s, or in other words, controlling the rhythm of the dance so that the singer, guitar player, and dancer are all on the same page. This important role sounds easy, but there is an art to clapping your hands in Flamenco, and that's exactly what you will learn in this workshop. Ever wonder what's happening when you watch a live Flamenco performance? Most Flamenco Tablaos are improvised, which is the beauty of this ancient art form. In this workshop, you'll learn Flamenco Comp√°s  and Palmas (rhythm and clapping).

NA,Sold out,NA,"A lo largo de dos d√≠as, a raz√≥n de tres horas cada d√≠a, se subrayar√° el contexto civilizatorio del tema de los patrones geom√©tricos y se discutir√° acerca de la manera de observar el espacio, que desempe√±a un papel de puente en la transferencia del legado del pasado al futuro. Los talleres abordar√°n el tema de leer el universo desde una perspectiva matem√°tica, se√±alando la s√≥lida estructura geom√©trica presente en las obras de nuestros ancestros, abordando al mismo tiempo el concepto de ‚ÄòArte de la Unidad‚Äô. Los monumentos arquitect√≥nicos del mundo isl√°mico que han construido civilizaciones desde Asia Central hasta al-Andalus/Iberia proporcionan datos que indican que estos patrones geom√©tricos pertenecen a una cultura y civilizaci√≥n comunes en t√©rminos de su estructura. En los √∫ltimos trabajos de Serap Ekizler S√∂nmez sobre relaciones de parentesco entre patrones, se abordan los patrones geom√©tricos en el contexto de la historia cultural. El tema de los patrones geom√©tricos, que se encuentra en la intersecci√≥n de la ciencia y el arte, solo puede ser comprendido en el contexto de la historia de la ciencia, y por lo tanto, en el contexto de la historia del pensamiento, si se comprende correctamente la geometr√≠a subyacente. Contenidos D√≠a 1: ¬øCu√°l es la estructura de los patrones geom√©tricos?; ¬øQu√© es la construcci√≥n con comp√°s y regla? ¬øQu√© significa la expansi√≥n infinita de patrones? Se explicar√°n temas como simetr√≠a especular, simetr√≠a de deslizamiento-reflexi√≥n, simetr√≠a rotacional y simetr√≠as de traslaci√≥n en conceptos como celda unitaria, patr√≥n de cuatro pliegues, patr√≥n de seis pliegues y patr√≥n de cinco pliegues al expresar patrones. En el primer d√≠a, se dibujar√° un patr√≥n de rect√°ngulo de ra√≠z cuadrada de tres pliegues. Nuevamente con seis pliegues, pero esta vez se dibujar√° un patr√≥n con una celda unitaria cuadrada. La geometr√≠a detr√°s de los patrones se examinar√° a fondo al compararla con el patr√≥n del primer d√≠a. Se se√±alar√°n lugares donde se ven patrones en los sely√∫cidas de Anatolia y sus caracter√≠sticas arquitect√≥nicas. D√≠a 2: Se combinar√°n los dise√±os del primer d√≠a, y se presentar√°n enfoques originales desarrollados en la construcci√≥n de nuevos dise√±os. Todo ello con el objetivo de desarrollar un taller interesante con un formato que adem√°s de divertido, sea informativo, presentando estas aplicaciones intrincadas desarrolladas a lo largo de muchos a√±os, de manera que adaptando estos dise√±os bidimensionales a s√≥lidos arquimedianos, se genere un cuboctaedro.

How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials?

The human species sleeps, without a calculus for MINDS LOST WITHOUT AN IDENTITY, where the ignorance of our shadows hidden deep within our minds are not limits, but valuable commodities of time, worth more than their weight in gold. Our minds control invaluable resources hidden within the 4th dimension, and if at all, we can unite the TIME of our thoughts to ideas that are greater than all of their shadows, our minds in its Thinking will guide us beyond who we desire to be. There are empirical references in time we all can scale in the 3rd dimension, which we can apply in accuracy to measures of the 4th dimension of our elusive minds. An empirical reference creates an understanding that reflects the physical world, immediately exposing the hidden imposters in our weaknesses, influenced by vocabularies which reinforce their limits over us. Our vocabulary, in whatever dialects they are spoken, are words we use internally to motivate change, but instead of encouraging us, the imperfections in our speech and articulation restrict access to our minds searching to embrace themselves in the inspirations that surround us. Thus, the mind rejects these hindrances, estranging itself from us and imagination, and becomes the unimaginable. The unimaginable is the opposite influence of vocabularies in what we think is impossible, as everything we are not, or can‚Äôt be, as realities beyond our limits we accept as who we are. Whereas the empirical reference of our minds are harmonic languages in imagination, teaching us why we think, where to look and how to SEE, as new opportunities hidden within the words, we speak to ourselves either in comfort or in our mental disparities. Mind ReMapping is a language illuminating an internal identity, so that we no longer need to be afraid of the dark, and nor do we need to be afraid of our minds and what future they will choose for us. If you want to know why we fear the future and the realities the external world holds for us all, it‚Äôs not because we don‚Äôt have the confidence to embrace our greatest choices, it is because our MINDS are LOST WITHOUT AN IDENTITY. If you remove imagination and its means to build an internal image of the self, you remove the cognitive navigations of Will and Influence for that identity to choose and decide clearly.

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.
