Mind ReMapping You may read this today and wonder, what values can we learn from Mind ReMapping? Your Mind is an atomic and perpetual energy. Its power is so complex that it carries no mass, but yet, derives energy not only from the natural sustainability of surrounding environments, but it perpetuates far greater power with the connections it makes with other minds where at our collective nucleus, is a nuclear energy which is unstoppable. This power, which for most of us is dormant, inspires its own potent energies, deriving power from genuine and respectful gestures we gift through the interactions we have with one another, in the simplest of, “Hellos, & how are you?” Its only through a connection with other minds, not money, nor possessions, that can pull us out of our lowest moments in life’s darkness, because nothing, not even FEAR, can survive the deep depths of Time, where FEAR abandons us to insanity or, we find salvation through a connection with other minds. However, the mind's energy when synchronised is unrivalled, as there is nothing more gargantuan than collective minds coming together because the mind must first perceive before it can conceive. Collective Minds that are empathic to one another are designed to create wormholes in Time, where either the greatest ideas are birthed, or where our worst nightmares are channelled through time. Wormholes in Time, of course, can be achieved in their singularities which can be truly exhilarating or horrific, but the wormholes we create together, open vaster passages in Time through which powers of Consciousness can manifest itself to us, in whatever we have asked it to become. That power to some, can present itself to be God, to some, it can be Spirituality, and to others, it can be the Sciences, the Arts, or any means where Consciousness can reach us through OPEN TIME. Imagine these wormholes as transmission gateways to higher or lower Dimensions, that for humans, are situated in the only place where Time can travel, whilst carrying our perceptions with it. That place is the 4 Dimensions of our Minds. At this point, we realise why our minds are so powerful because they are PORTALS of TIME, and why, we are often kept divided, pitting advantages against one another over trivial conflicts, because we have forgotten who we are. We are not aware we are lowering our status as a species which redirects Times energy toward alternative sources that close time, straining and weakening mind transmissions. However, what is being attempted above all our own primitive needs, is that certain Timelines of Consciousness are being fragmented. Consciousness is an intelligence of unities, where strength in numbers creates infinities which either, flourish in life, or instead, are infinities that perpetuate repetitive downward spirals. The next revolution is not going to be the takeover of A.I. as we are sold and told because it is too obvious, it instead, will be the invisible Decimations of minds only looking out for themselves, or it will be the Raptures of people who know their Minds, bringing Times of life, together.

Concurrently, as it also emerged from COP28, the global challenge of climate change remains yet unresolved. Nevertheless, this crisis could also be an opportunity for our common space. A chance to use the current energy landscape to reaffirm the Mediterranean Region as the main bridge between Europe, Africa and the Middle East and to collectively succeed the energy transition and climate issues. In this context, WEC Italy (Italian National Committee of the World Energy Council) fosters the international dialogue on Euro MED energy Transition, coordinating the WEC Med cross-regional collaboration initiative, developed in collaboration with OMEC (Organisation Méditerranéenne de l'Energie et du Climat) and WEC General Secretariat, with Vice Chairs of Africa, Europe, the Gulf States and the Middle East which aims to strengthen regional dialogue and cooperation in the Mediterranean basin. The main deliverable of the first year of work of the Initiative will be the ''WEC MED Energy Transition Checklist'', a map of the energy agenda of the Area which highlights the challenges the Region is facing in the medium-long term; a document developed thanks to the contribution of WEC Mediterranean national Committees and the main stakeholders active in the process, including OMEC, MEDREG, MEDTSO, WFP, industry sector, Universities and IFIs. Starting with the main findings of the last edition of OMEC’s Mediterranean Energy Perspectives publication, the Conference will be an important occasion to delve in-depth into the most important issues related to energy transition and energy security, with institutional representatives, international organizations, and stakeholders of the national and international energy scene, addressing both challenges and opportunities in a context of great uncertainty, where the choices made today for the region will shape our common future and are crucial to help stirring away from unsustainable current trends. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 👉 AGENDA 👈 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ By registering you allow WEC Italy to recorder and share pictures and video from the event and to subscribe your address on WEC Italy's mailing list for future communication (you can unsubs from the mailing list in any time).",0,0,EUR,WEC Italia,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-12T13:00:00Z,2024-03-12T16:30:00Z,Transitioning Energy in the Mediterranean,An international high level panel to deepen the most important issues of energy transition and energy security in the area,https://www.eventbrite.it/e/biglietti-transitioning-energy-in-the-mediterranean-795394324837,roma,NA

Presso il locale potrai, oltre a bere cocktails eccellenti, anche degustare un menù nel quale puoi trovare i dumplings, ravioli cinesi artigianali con ripieno di black angus o pollo e verza o funghi porcini e pollo, ancora panini con tartare di danese con stracciata di bufala e spinacino croccante, i wrap di pulled pork o ancora i club sandwich più invitanti della notte romana oltre a tante sfiziosità a rotazione fuori menù come le puntarelle fresche alla romana.Ebbene sì: torna finalmente l’Open Mic più imprevedibile della capitale. Lo abbiamo fatto di nuovo, ma meglio: i talenti comici più raffinati del panorama romano si alterneranno sul palco del Charleston con pezzi inediti, freschi e - spesso - fallimentari.

1 ora 30 minuti,NA,"Con una scrittura più matura e la sua consueta naturalezza nell'affrontare tematiche complesse, Alice Urciuolo, sceneggiatrice delle serie “Skam” e “Prisma”, entra con questo romanzo nelle pieghe delle relazioni amorose manipolatorie, raccontando l’ambiguità e le forme mutevoli della dipendenza emotiva. Milena Cervi ha quindici anni quando sua madre Angelica entra nella Chiesa della Verità, un culto nato a Roccanuova, paese tra le montagne della Ciociaria, e presto diffusosi in tutta Italia. Il leader spirituale di questa Chiesa, che molti definiscono una «setta», è Tiziano Valentini, ex impiegato di banca e padre di famiglia. I suoi fedeli giurano che compia opere straordinarie, i suoi detrattori sostengono con uguale convinzione che sia un truffatore. Nel corso del tempo, Milena assiste impotente al cambiamento della madre: Angelica fa continue donazioni in denaro e si mostra sempre più incapace di riconoscere le ambiguità del culto di cui fa parte, mentre suo marito, pur di non separarsi da lei, l’asseconda e spera in un suo ravvedimento. Così, per sfuggire al destino che sembra inghiottire la sua famiglia, a vent’anni Milena decide di trasferirsi a Roma. Qui incontra Emanuele, un uomo più grande di lei nel quale crede di vedere la cifra del suo riscatto. La loro relazione all’inizio si presenta come un perfetto sogno d’amore, ma presto assume i contorni di un rapporto manipolatorio, di un legame tanto più doloroso quanto più difficile da spezzare. Un legame non così diverso da quello che tiene stretta sua madre a Tiziano.

MIXING IDENTITIES analyzes the hidden parts of our identities, through an immersive experience inside the fascinating universe of the complex labyrinths of our consciousness. The human body is a changing system that connects us with other bodies and spaces to perceive the surrounding reality; a strong communication system with its own language and infinite ways of expression. FUTURE LANDSCAPES are abstract, infinite and conceptual, associated with a sense of freedom and infinite extension. Primarily experienced with the mind, spaces redefine their limits and borders, transforming surfaces in an open flow of pure ideas. This section focuses on the concept of the borders and the structures between body, mind and soul, the human identity and the city, the space and the ground. more. https://www.itsliquid.com/opening-romeartfair-9th.html",0,0,EUR,ITSLIQUID GROUP,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-12T14:00:00Z,2024-03-12T18:00:00Z,ROME INTERNATIONAL ART FAIR – 9TH EDITION,ROME INTERNATIONAL ART FAIR – 9TH EDITION,https://www.eventbrite.it/e/biglietti-rome-international-art-fair-9th-edition-846048532937,roma,Sold out
