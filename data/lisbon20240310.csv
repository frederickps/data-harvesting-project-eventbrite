Our ability to use our mind determines how well we can control our external realities. What you may not know is that our Minds have an identity. Creating an Identity of mind allows us to direct our external world intentionally. The language we use to run our lives is one dimensional, which creates needless limitations. Our minds work best in a multidimensional language. Learning how to access your minds resources correctly will enable you to create a life beyond who we desire to be. Our vocabulary, are words we use internally to motivate change, but instead of encouraging us, the imperfections in our speech and articulation restrict access to our minds. There is no synchronicity between the one-dimensional language in our speech and the 4 th dimension of the mind.
