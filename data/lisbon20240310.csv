Our ability to use our mind determines how well we can control our external realities. What you may not know is that our Minds have an identity. Creating an Identity of mind allows us to direct our external world intentionally. The language we use to run our lives is one dimensional, which creates needless limitations. Our minds work best in a multidimensional language. Learning how to access your minds resources correctly will enable you to create a life beyond who we desire to be. Our vocabulary, are words we use internally to motivate change, but instead of encouraging us, the imperfections in our speech and articulation restrict access to our minds. There is no synchronicity between the one-dimensional language in our speech and the 4 th dimension of the mind. If you’re not using the correct language of the mind, the mind disengages where we become confused. We don’t have the language to describe the life that we want in a way that the mind accepts, understands, and can utilise.

It sits in one of Lisbon hills (the city is known for its 7 hills), with the castle sitting on top with a privileged view of the city and the Tagus river. There is no better place to feel the old city vibe than in Alfama. Part of its charm is actually its apparent degradation, intricate streets and the sound of fado music in every corner. Here, you will not be amazed with magnificent monuments. Instead, you will be delighted with the simplicity and the genuinity of the people and the spectacular view points. With our Free Tour in Lisbon, you will get to know Alfama, and the surrounding neighbourhoods, as one of our friends visiting. We will tell you its secrets and legends, the reason why there’s so many tiles and why do the streets form a kind of labyrinth. But don’t worry, you will only get lost if you want to!
