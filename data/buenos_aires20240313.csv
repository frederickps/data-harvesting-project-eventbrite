And a big part of what you have to teach, is wisdom, insights, human nature, understanding of business. Good economy, bad economy, bad employees are dime a dozen. Good employees? Your business competitors are not only working on stealing your customers away from you, they are also working on stealing your best employees from you. You are competing against other employers to attract and keep high quality employees. And your best employees? In this knowledge based economy, best employees know the key to their own long term well-being is their own skill set. They are hungry for knowledge, for wisdom, they want what's in your head, and they want you to make their learning experience inspirational not painful. If you refuse to teach them, if you are not effective at coaching, or if it's unpleasant to learn under you (you are a typical tyrant of a boss from 1950 LOL) they will quit and go somewhere else for the learning experience.

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

1 hour 15 minutes,NA,"For entrepreneurial activity to translate into economic growth, entrepreneurship education needs to focus less on the “start” and “small” side of things and more on how companies of all ages, sizes and sectors scale. After all, the company founders and successful entrepreneurs that we know today are famous not because they started but because they scaled.A scaleup can be described as any organisation that is undergoing rapid growth. Most businesses are surprised to see that past practices do not work well when going from 1x to 2x and 3x. That is because scaling up a business is qualitatively different from starting it. Scaling up needs a growth mindset and important decisions to be taken in areas such as purpose, product, process and people. Join Professor Haslam for a face-to-face Master Class on ""The New Era of Scaleup Entrepreneurship"" where he will explain how the entrepreneurship landscape is changing away from startups and towards scaleups. About the speaker Professor Joe Haslam is the Executive Director of the Owners Scaleup Program at IE Business School in Madrid, Spain, a program specially designed for small and medium sized companies that want to scale.  In 1998, Prof Haslam was on the founding Team of Marrakech, a Dublin based e-procurement company that raised over $75m in Venture Capital and scaled to over 250 people. He is the co-founder and Chairman of Hot Hotels, the first company from Spain to be accelerated by the Techstars program in the USA (Boston, Summer 2015).   ",0,0,EUR,IE University - Argentina,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-13T21:45:00Z,2024-03-13T23:00:00Z,The new Era of ScaleUp Entrepreneurship,Master Class in Buenos Aires with IE Professor Joe Haslam,https://www.eventbrite.es/e/the-new-era-of-scaleup-entrepreneurship-tickets-840035196887,buenos_aires,NA
