While its predecessor Under The Manchineel was a bristly beast of dark and thunderous swill pounding monstrous riffs and bleak lyrics mostly into the area underneath your chest, the new effort cuts higher, right at the heart and brain, although no less heavy. After the almost simultaneous demise of Germany’s Noise-stalwarts ULME and the 2nd spring of seminal Crossover punk/metal icons JINGO DE LUNCH, Ulme-guitarist and singer Arne and Jingo de Lunch singer Yvonne formed an acoustic bit named Treedeon. After the addition drummer Boomer and a full amplified gig, the band found themselves on the map for lovers of Noise, Sludge, and all kinds of heavy pumping riffage, combined with an emotional approach and intimate lyrics. They released three records via Exile on Mainstream, ""Lowest Level Reincarnation"" in 2015 and ""Under The Manchineel"" in 2017.

Im Anschluss laden wir alle Teilnehmenden dazu ein, mit uns in lockerer Runde den Abend mit anregenden Gesprächen und Lachen ausklingen zu lassen. Beim nächsten Termin am 13.03.2024 geht es um das spannende Thema :Das Nutzen von multiplen neuronalen Stimulationen – der Körper im Coaching Petra Bernhardt wird in ihrem Input-Vortrag verschiedene Formen der neuronalen Stimulation im Coaching vorstellen, darunter das Beklopfen von Akupunkturpunkten, Augenbewegungen und Embodiment. Zusätzlich zeigt sie Schauspieltechniken wie die Subtextarbeit. Der Vortrag bietet auch einen Einblick in das kommende Systemische Seminar ""Verdecktes Arbeiten"" beim INSTITUT FÜR SYSTEMISCHE KOMPETENZ (ISK), das hilfreich bei sensiblen, komplexen Themen ist. Durch das ""Verdeckte Arbeiten"" eröffnen sich neue Perspektiven für Klienten. Bernhardt möchte Coaches mit praxisnahen Beispielen und Tools inspirieren, um ihre Methodenauswahl zu bereichern und den fachlichen Austausch zu fördern. Um allen QSA-Mitgliedern und anderen Interessierten die Teilnahme zu ermöglichen, findet Evening Shine als Hybrid-Veranstaltung statt, d.h. Input-Referat und Diskussion werden parallel online gestreamt. Als SystemikerInnen wollen wir als Bundesverband für Qualität in der systemischen Arbeit eine starke Community bilden, damit wir unsere Haltungen und unser Wissen in die Welt tragen können, die zu alternativen Denk- und Handlungsweisen inspirieren. Unser Ziel ist es, durch das Wirken unserer Community-Mitglieder immer mehr Systeme zu ermöglichen, in denen Menschen sich als kompetent, liebenswürdig und wertvoll erfahren sowie Autonomie und Zugehörigkeit erleben können.

For those wishing to continue, successive sessions can then be booked. WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION The workshop, which takes place as a series of classes, is called as such because of its exploratory nature. It serves as a space for development and discovery, where individuals engage in artistic exploration and growth. This journey is an experimental introduction to figure drawing for complete beginners to intermediate level. You will discover how to relate to and draw the human body in an investigational way, rather than through classical methods. Through the course, you will learn about using materials that suit your individual style. Materials used in both dry and wet techniques can be soft pastels, charcoal, ink, a variety of pencils, and brushwork. History of art will be integrated into the course and directly influence the sessions, creating a basis for you to discover your unique artistic talent. Basic general information about human anatomy is provided, though the course is not based on a classical method. We will use printed material and no live model will be present. My teachings will be just the start of your own personal application and purpose. The classes are going to be in groups of maximum 5 people, to create an intimate work space and for me to dedicate enough time to each person. Each session will end with a discussion, exchange of ideas, and feedback on the learning process. ABOUT SALVATORE SICILIANO, THE WORKSHOP TUTOR The workshop is based on Salvatore's artistic approach to the human figure and it has the goal to make you discover your uniqueness and talent. Salvatore's experience in choreography and painting is the ground he will utilize to lead the workshop and to explore the beauty of the human body with you. ""Painting is impactful, but drawing is intimate, drawing is home"". Salvatore pursued fine arts at Accademia di Brera in Milan, coupled with dance and choreography at Accademia Susanna Beltrami. During his studies in Milan, he collaborated as a choreographer and visual artist with NABA Milano, Istituto Europeo di Design Milano, and Ansaldo Space Fashion and Design. Since 2012 he worked as a dancer throughout Europe and in 2015 he founded Siciliano Contemporary Ballet (SCB) in Berlin.

About the facilitator Eszter Kalóz (she/her) is a holistic dance-movement facilitator and yoga teacher based in Berlin. She’s absolutely fascinated by the wisdom of the body and the wealth of knowledge and experiences we can find through (re-)connecting to it, which is why she’s committed to creating and holding spaces where she can guide and accompany people so that they can meet themselves on a deeper level, where they can drop into their bodies and into ‘being’, ‘sensing’, ‘allowing’ instead of ‘doing’, ‘wanting’ or ‘forcing’.  Whether yoga or dance/movement, what she offers is influenced by an ongoing research into her own body, mind and spirit and therefore has a constantly evolving form.

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

NA,Refunds up to 1 day before event,"I would like to invite you to an original creative session. We will paint together, listen to great Techno music and get to a flow state. This workshop is meant for you to express your creativity. You won’t need to buy materials and you don’t need to have prior painting experience. You just need to show up and enjoy the process. In the end you will have a beautiful work of art (acrylic on canvas), made by you, ready to be hung on your walls.  How it goes: First we will explore the creative process, and decide on the color palette for each person. Then we will absorb ourselves in the music and learn how to translate its energy into painting. You will be personally instructed in the unique technique and the use of colors. We will begin to work in layers of color. You will be immersed in the creative process, forgetting your everyday life and expressing your inner playfulness. We will take one break to dry the layers, discuss the process, evaluate the outcome so far and decide how to proceed. During the break drinks will be served. This workshop has been running since summer 2018 on Airbnb Experience platform and has over 286 five star reviews:  ""Dina has curated a really special experience! She’s super talented, very kind and is helpful throughout the entire process.

It's really cool."" - Sherace, Mar 18, 2023 ""Dina's painting experience is the best thing I have found through Airbnb or other sites while traveling. She guides you a bit and also encourages you throughout. All while listening to an excellent playlist and having genuine conversation. Highly recommend!"" - Rebekah, Jan 27, 2023 “It’s been the second time that I did Techno Painting with Dina – last time I went with a friend, this time I brought my family. Dina is an incredible person and her stories and sharing of her experiences is breathtaking. Painting with her technique is fun and leads to beautiful results thanks to her caring guidance. I hope a third time will be coming up soon :-).” – Franziska, February 2020 “Dina has found her zone of genius with techno painting and I’m grateful that she’s sharing her gifts with the world through this Airbnb experience. Arriving to her place was super easy and once all the students gathered, Dina was off to the races. “Let go of all expectations. This is a process and you’ll get into flow state. There’s no room for your thoughts or ego.” I had never painted with acrylic but was surprised on the end result. But again, it was the journey that was so amazing – spiritual if I may say. Dina has inspired me to continue to pursue techno painting and channel my inner creative juices in the form of art I can include in my surroundings or share with loved ones. If you’re reading this, just go ahead and book it, YOU WILL HAVE A MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE.” – Ankurman, January 2020 “We had such a fantastic and unique experience with Dina . She put us at ease on arrival and we had fascinating conversations throughout. The technique she uses is easy and everyone can try with no experience needed. Sharing the experience with another couple just added to the fun . Dina also has a deep knowledge of the Berlin club scene which has been a huge influence on her life and inspired this progression into the professional art world. Recommend this experience to everyone and anyone !” – Robert, June 2019 “This experience with Dina was rich, fun, and genuine. Dina is a contagious, spirit of life and love. When she opened the door it was like meeting a old friend. Her approach to painting through this intuitive, techno music approach is authentic to her style and passion.

Mind ReMapping You may read this today and wonder, what values can we learn from Mind ReMapping? Your Mind is an atomic and perpetual energy. Its power is so complex that it carries no mass, but yet, derives energy not only from the natural sustainability of surrounding environments, but it perpetuates far greater power with the connections it makes with other minds where at our collective nucleus, is a nuclear energy which is unstoppable. This power, which for most of us is dormant, inspires its own potent energies, deriving power from genuine and respectful gestures we gift through the interactions we have with one another, in the simplest of, “Hellos, & how are you?” Its only through a connection with other minds, not money, nor possessions, that can pull us out of our lowest moments in life’s darkness, because nothing, not even FEAR, can survive the deep depths of Time, where FEAR abandons us to insanity or, we find salvation through a connection with other minds. However, the mind's energy when synchronised is unrivalled, as there is nothing more gargantuan than collective minds coming together because the mind must first perceive before it can conceive. Collective Minds that are empathic to one another are designed to create wormholes in Time, where either the greatest ideas are birthed, or where our worst nightmares are channelled through time. Wormholes in Time, of course, can be achieved in their singularities which can be truly exhilarating or horrific, but the wormholes we create together, open vaster passages in Time through which powers of Consciousness can manifest itself to us, in whatever we have asked it to become. That power to some, can present itself to be God, to some, it can be Spirituality, and to others, it can be the Sciences, the Arts, or any means where Consciousness can reach us through OPEN TIME. Imagine these wormholes as transmission gateways to higher or lower Dimensions, that for humans, are situated in the only place where Time can travel, whilst carrying our perceptions with it. That place is the 4 Dimensions of our Minds. At this point, we realise why our minds are so powerful because they are PORTALS of TIME, and why, we are often kept divided, pitting advantages against one another over trivial conflicts, because we have forgotten who we are. We are not aware we are lowering our status as a species which redirects Times energy toward alternative sources that close time, straining and weakening mind transmissions. However, what is being attempted above all our own primitive needs, is that certain Timelines of Consciousness are being fragmented. Consciousness is an intelligence of unities, where strength in numbers creates infinities which either, flourish in life, or instead, are infinities that perpetuate repetitive downward spirals. The next revolution is not going to be the takeover of A.I. as we are sold and told because it is too obvious, it instead, will be the invisible Decimations of minds only looking out for themselves, or it will be the Raptures of people who know their Minds, bringing Times of life, together. That choice is yours, therefore, OPEN TIME! Meta Tech Organica – Excited about New Dimensions of LIVING. Mind ReMapping N.B.

NA,"Kontaktieren Sie den Veranstalter, um eine Rückerstattung anzufordern.","Hallo, wie schön, dass du hier her gefunden hast! 🕊 Wir sind Nina und Mitja, Lebens- und Atempartner, und hier um dich auf deine Reise zu dir selbst zu begleiten. Als zertifizierte Atem- und Energietherapeuten ist es unser Wunsch, Breathwork als sehr mächtiges Tool für Selbsterfahrung und -entfaltung an möglichst viele Menschen weiter zu geben - damit eine tiefe Verbindung zu sich selbst und ein bewusstes Leben für jeden möglich ist. ✨ Was erwartet mich auf einer Atemreise? Unsere Atemreise ist eine Form von Conscious Breathwork. Sie ist simpel, technikfrei und erfordert kein besonderes Vorwissen. Über bewusstes tiefes Atmen kannst du dich in einen erweiterten Bewusstseinszustand bringen, in dem blockierende Denk- und Verhaltensmuster erkannt und wieder aufgelöst werden und du dein wahres Potenzial zum Leben erweckst. Jede Reise ist individuell und immer anders. Zu den Wirkungen können innere Klarheit, tiefe Verbundenheit und starke Körperwahrnehmung gehören, sowie intensive Tranceerfahrungen, in denen deine Reise nicht nur im Körper bleibt, sondern bis ins Universum reicht. ✨ Wie ist eine Atemreise aufgebaut? Unsere Atemreise beginnt mit einer Kennenlernrunde, in der jeder gehört und gesehen werden darf, mündet über in eine kurze Körperübung, um den Alltag einmal abzuschütteln, bevor schließlich die Breathwork Session beginnt. Diese geht etwa 60-75 Minuten und wird von einem thematisch passenden Musikset begleitet, welches dich auf deiner Reise unterstützt. Zum Abschluss gibt es ein Sharing, in dem das Erlebte geteilt werden darf. Da eine Atemreise viel Energie verbraucht, belohnen wir unseren Körper und unsere Seele danach noch mit ein paar leckeren Snacks. ✨ Wie bereite ich mich auf eine Atemreise vor? Wir empfehlen ca. 2 Stunden vor einer Atemreise nichts Schweres zu Essen, da ein voller Bauch das Atmen erschwert. Zieh dir für die Breathwork Session etwas Bequemes an und bring dir etwas zu trinken mit - alles andere haben wir vor Ort da. Du kannst den Raum ab 19.45 Uhr betreten. Die Teilnehmerzahl ist auf 11 Personen begrenzt. Wir freuen uns mit dir auf deine ganz persönliche Atemreise zu gehen! 💫 Nina & Mitja IG: @atemreise_berlin 🌳 Testimonials ""Wow, was für eine Reise!!

Forget small spaces, darkness, and spiders, standing up in front of a crowd and talking is far more terrifying for most people. Through this workshop your participants will become more confident and relaxed in front of an audience which will translate into a successful speaking event. Leading Effective Teams Training: This training based on leading teams will help you to develop anyone that leads a team or is involved in a leadership role. It is also useful for those that are about to embark on a position of leadership or need to develop their leadership skills. Train the Trainer Training: Whether you are preparing to be a professional trainer, or you are someone who does a bit of training as a part of their job, you always want to be prepared. Your participants will understand that training is a process where skills, knowledge, and attitudes are applied in a unique way. Presentation Skills Training: In a survey carried out amongst experienced, middle and senior executives, designed to determine the things that they feared most, public speaking came out as number one. Death was eighth on the list! So, most of us would rather die than stand up and present! Practical Sales Skills Training: These practical sales skills training has been developed for salespeople or people who are required to sell as part of their role. This course is applicable for both people relatively new to sales as well as those who have a lot of experience as the content is flexible enough to adapt to suit the audience. Conflict Management Training: Disagreements, differences of opinion and conflicting perspectives on key issues inevitably arise in any context where people are working together. Research has shown that workplace conflicts can become highly destructive. Negative emotions may be stirred up, poisoning team morale, creating stress and destroying relationships. Power Query and Power Pivot for Excel Training: Power BI (including Power Query & Power Pivot) are the biggest Excel news items in the last 10 years. They give Excel users the power to draw information out of multiple sources, link it together then perform calculations on it that can then be sliced & diced any way you want. Essential Management Skills Training: Every day, managers solve difficult problems, turn organisations around, and achieve astonishing performance. To be successful, every organisation needs good managers. Manager Management  Training: With this course, you will be able to provide the skills, guidance, and empowerment to your team of managers. They will then be better suited in leading and motivating their team and thus produce fantastic results. To be a successful manager means having a wide range of skills. Through this workshop, you will be able to disperse your knowledge and experience throughout your leadership team. Sales Presentation Mastery Training: Sales are the absolute most essential component of any business, and selling skills are the most highly valued skills in today’s business landscape. The world's fastest growing and most successful businesses have one thing in common: they have effective sales people that drive their business forward. Time Management Training: Personal time management skills are essential for professional success in any workplace. Those able to successfully implement time management strategies are able to control their workload rather than spend each day in a frenzy of activity reacting to crisis after crisis - stress declines and personal productivity soars! These highly effective individuals are able to focus on the tasks with the greatest impact to them and their organization.

Durch Meditation, sanften yogischen Übungen und tantrischen Ritualen werdet ihr eine sehr innige und tiefe Verbindung erleben und spüren. Das Ritual wendet sich vor allem an Paare, welche sich nah stehen und sich auf einer neuen sexuellen Ebene begegnen möchten. ​ Ihr weckt eure sexuelle Energie und verbindet diese mit der Herzenergie, so dass beides in einem unendlichen Strom von Liebe miteinander fließen kann. ​ Im Liebesritual geht es vor allem darum, euch mit euren Energien (Chakren) zu verbinden und diese miteinander verschmelzen zu lassen.

Create meaningful connections with people who are on the same page about dating as you are. No more swiping Could Berlin be a place where you find love? Dating in Berlin is challenging – too many options to make a choice and not enough compatible options to actually date, high and unrealistic expectations or no expectations and interest in commitment at all, friendzoning, ghosting, emotional unavailability – the list can go on. We get it – it can get really frustrating. That is why we would like to introduce you to our speed dating event that might just be the first step to change this series of unfortunate events (last time it did the job) THE CONCEPT: We have created a perfect opportunity to do things differently, the question is – are you ready to make the next step? Talking via screen does not even compare to real human connection. We invite all men and women with different backgrounds, who are based in Berlin and are interested in something more than what apps have to offer – we are talking about looking for a relationship or even a life partner! The concept is simple – 10 men meet 10 women (age: 25-35)*. Will you be leaving with a match and a secured date? Will you meet your soulmate or end up making new friends? Either way there is no losing in this game! *20 is our target number of participants. It may however differ due to circumstances. PROGRAM: 19:00 – 19:30 – Introduction You will grab a glass of Prosecco and get to know other attendants. It is time to break the ice and get to know each other a little bit 19:30 – 20:30 – Game time! Men will be assigned to one of the 10 stations and girls will keep moving. We will play 10 rounds (6 minutes each) – that way everyone gets a chance to talk to everyone. Participants will engage in authentic and meaningful conversations, with the support of special cards designed by our compatibility expert. You will also get to enjoy a glass of your favourite wine Throughout the process, you will be given Match Cards to make notes about the new people that you meet – you will be able to decide who you would like to move forward with and who would you perhaps like to keep as a friend? 20:30 – 21:30 – Time for mingling Now that you have talked to everyone you can exchange your thoughts and experiences with other attendees or continue building meaningful connections with others.

NA,NA,"Please, read this description till the end before you come to the event. Thank you very much! given by Regina LoMío (dance teacher, facebook.com/reginalomio ) organized by LoMío (facebook.com/lomiosi) This a private event, so you don't need to say you are interested on individual dates here. If you truly are interested, please, send me (Regina LoMío: lomiocontact@gmail.com) a message for or about a session request. Dance is not just the art form in which movement is provoked by and/or synchronized with music and sounds, it is also a (very human) way to express feelings, mental states, identities in a way akin to (social) body language, for instance. To dance well you need technical prowess, confidence, imagination, and sense of context. The last three are psychologically relevant categories which define aspects of the personality and also are constantly affected by the person's mental/emotional health. Dancing is not just dancing. Dancing can be much more than just movements. In this event we will approach the act of dancing as deliberately ritual, transcendental, indeed mindful. In a ritualized setup, like in the traditional rites associated to ancient cults and cultures, dancing can be a healing tool when coupled with conscious cultural learning and mindful techniques. There is the possibility to work on dance and movement patterns that would be suitable to anyone willing to improve their body-mind connection, indeed their psychological/neurological well-being. We intend to do so through promoting self-expression, a healthy balance between non-inhibition and self-control, body positivism, rhythmical prowess, movement coordination, movement synchronization and movement independence (distinguishing from body parts, e.g., arms, legs, head) when dancing to polyrhythmic music, conscious psychological and/or cultural identification with the subject and imagery of the music and the context (dance rite); and, whenever possible, we will aim at reaching transcendental and spiritually relevant states of the mind beyond the actual dance. Each session is appropriate for either only one client or up to a maximum of five (5) persons at the time. I will offer three different styles: Afro Cuban (link to previous event: https://fb.me/e/18ejz25ji) Techno-based (link to previous event: https://fb.me/e/1AzZbsW7j) free-style (link to previous event: https://fb.me/e/4umj0WFbh) with diverse popular music of choice It is totally up to you (a person or a 5-heads group) which style you would like in your session, and in fact, you can experience all in the same single session or alternate between the styles through more than one session. Just notify in advance per e-mail or private message here in Facebook about your preferred event settings. The ritual dance sessions would allow us not just to work on the appropriate dance/movement patterns but also verbal feedback and conversations on the topics of emotional/mental health relevant to you, as well as the exchange of music, video, and literature material that you wish to obtain. Water, tea, and eventually self-made non-alcoholic fermented beverages will be served and free of any charge. Session plan (persons, pricing, and inscription): The event is designed in a flexible manner allowing sessions involving from one to five persons per session. There will be three different kinds of session plans regarding the number of attendees, payment method, and inscription deadlines. - Plan A: for just one individual who would pay 40 EUR per hour (a 120-min (2-hours) session will cost 80 EUR) and you can request 1 hour, 1 hour 30 minutes, or 2 hours of dance session. Only cash will be accepted when you pay on arrival or during a session. You can book a session up to three (3) days prior to your desired date, and you can cancel anytime via e-mail or phone should you not make it. - Plan B: for a maximum of five (5) people, who would possibly be befriended/acquainted (eg. close friends, job colleagues) in advance and would whenever possible request the 2-hours session and transfer the payment of 75 EUR via PayPal or bank transfer jointly as a group. You can also split the transfers (for instance, 15 EUR per person) specifying the date and time of the session in your transfer. In any case you (as a group) need to do so at least ten (10) days ahead of your desired date, so that the transfer would be confirmed by me at least one week before the session. Refund only possible until five (5) days before the session and then if two (2) of you have to cancel and request refund the session would be cancelled unless the remaining three (3) want to pay 75 EUR jointly or 10 EUR more per head. Finally if on the day of the session some cannot attend the event would still go ahead even if it is with only one client. - Plan C: for four (4) to five (5) not necessarily related persons who notify attendance three (3) days in advance and pay 25 EUR on arrival but take the risk that if less than three (1 or 2) attend the event is cancelled, unless they want to pay 75 EUR jointly on arrival. This means that if I receive a request for a date where someone else already booked a Plan C session, I would add persons to that date until there are five potential attendees. All of you will receive a notification from me about the planned session and whether or not there are at least four (4) people enrolled, which is the minimum required in this case to confirm the session's occurrence. I will also make a choice of music, dance style, and emotional/spiritual themes after talking to all the attendees and getting a feel of what best would suit the whole group, i.e. a sort of conscious addition and/or common denominator result of all of your interests together. Otherwise If you request a Plan C session on a date where someone else already booked a Plan A (individual) session I would then ask that person whether it is ok that you attend their session. If they agree you'd pay only 25 EUR for the 2-hours session while the person who originally requested the individual session pays 50 EUR (instead of 80 EUR) and still gets to decide which music, dance style, and/or emotional/spiritual themes we will addressed in the session. You can also just split the 75-EUR fee and make it a truly shared 2-persons session if you wish so but the choice of dance/music style and themes would have already been defined by the person who originally requested the individual session. I will constantly post on the event's discussion which dates already are booked and through which plan and style, though not at all by whom. Hygienic measures: Available sanitary conditions will be provided so you can wash hands, and windows will be open several times to ensure the room is well aired. Please, beware it may not be suitable for you if you are allergic to cat hair. Level: Level-independent Inscription and dates: Just send a private message to LoMío's facebook page or an e-mail to Regina LoMio (LoMío) lomiocontact@gmail.com. Provide a phone number through which I could contact you (preferably smartphone's apps like Signal or Telegram). Once we are in contact through phone I would share the address with you and we can arrange a dance date and a payment method according to your prospected plan (see above, A, B, or C). Available dates are Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Saturdays between 16:00 and 21:00, which means you can arrange a dance date either 16:00-18:00 or 19:00-21:00 on any of these days. Outfits: Training outfits, sports wear, or similar. Language: English (German or Spanish on request). Address: Indoors, somewhere in the Viktoriapark neighborhood. You will get the exact address after contacting me.",0,0,EUR,LoMío,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-12T15:00:00Z,2024-03-12T20:00:00Z,Small-group and individual ritual dance sessions,"More than private dance lessons and not exactly a psychotherapy, but definitively an intimate rite with you and/or your (potential) friends",https://www.eventbrite.de/e/small-group-and-individual-ritual-dance-sessions-tickets-699540684017,berlin,Sold out

11 days 4 hours,NA,"Note: The exhibition is open on Tue-Wed and Fri-Sat, 15-19hThe exhibition doesn't have an opening event. ​Welcome!""I look at the moment of painting, the minimum amount of time it takes. The object of the work needs to be the object of the gaze. It needs time for thought. Plans, observations and experiences wait for their moment and are condensed into colours, movement and shapes.However, doing things also needs time to think about the thoughts that come to mind or that the thoughts have time to form in the first place. When painting, you have time to feel what painting is to me. It's thought, play, humming, pungent mixing of colors. When I work with my hands, when I create something new, I ground myself in this being. Then I will know my place, whose right I am questioning at the same time.On display is a series of monotypes on used sheets, in which I study the absorption of colors into fabric and washing wrinkles, color overtones, and the role of light in colors when light penetrates a fabric hanging in the air. With monotype, I get to paint on a slippery surface and get the movement of painting involved in the process. This series of works started from the need for painting and my own space. I noticed that I seemed to be painting the space around me.""The exhibition is supported by the Finnish Cultural Foundation and the City of Oulu.Johanna Pöykkö (b 1977) is a visual artist based in Oulu, Finland. Pöykkö is studying the individual as part of a larger whole and the passage of time. For a long time, sheet fabric has been involved in making art as a material and as a transporter of information, a transmitter, and serigraphy as a technique. Pöykkö creates textile-based installations and sculptures in which colours, lights and shadows create a spatial whole. Pöykkö's works have been exhibited e.g. Oulu Art Museum, Forssa Museum, Kemi Art Museum and Craft Museum of Finland.***“Ich sehe mir den Moment des Malens an, die Mindestzeit, die es braucht. Das Objekt der Arbeit muss das Objekt des Blickes sein. Das Denken erfordert Zeit. Pläne, Beobachtungen und Erfahrungen warten auf ihren Moment und werden in Farben, Bewegungen und Formen komprimiert.​Jedoch braucht es auch Zeit, Dinge zu tun, da man über die Gedanken, die einem kommen, nachdenken muss oder damit die Gedanken Zeit haben, überhaupt zu entstehen. Beim Malen habe ich Zeit, zu fühlen, was Malen für mich bedeutet. Es sind Gedanken, ein Spiel, Summen, eine stechende Mischung aus Farben. Wenn ich mit meinen Händen arbeite, wenn ich etwas Neues kreiere, denke ich daran. Dann weiß ich, wo ich hingehöre, während ich das Recht darauf zur gleichen Zeit in Frage stelle.Die Ausstellung zeigt eine Reihe Monotypen auf gebrauchten Leintüchern, mit denen ich die Aufnahme von Farben in Stoffen, Waschfalten, Farbobertöne und die Rolle des Lichtes in Farben untersuche, wenn Licht einen Stoff durchstrahlt, der in der Luft hängt. Mit dem Monotyp male ich auf einer rutschigen Oberfläche und binde die Bewegung des Malens in den Prozess mit ein. Diese Werkereihe entstand, da ich ein Bedürfnis nach Malen und meinem eigenen Raum hatte. Ich bemerkte, dass ich den Raum um mich herum malte.”​Die Ausstellung wird von der finnischen Kulturstiftung und der Stadt Oulu unterstützt.Johanna Pöykkö (geb. 1977) ist eine bildende Künstlerin aus Oulu, Finnland. Pöykkö studiert das Individuum als Teil eines größeren Ganzen und in dem Ablauf der Zeit. Leintuchstoff wurde lange Zeit in der Kunst als Material, beim Informationstransport als Transmitter und beim Siebdruck als Technik eingesetzt. Pöykkö kreiert textilbasierte Installationen und Skulpturen, bei denen Farben, Lichter und Schatten ein räumliches Ganzes bilden.

NA,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

They are hungry for knowledge, for wisdom, they want what's in your head, and they want you to make their learning experience inspirational not painful.

You have more responsibilities than others, but you don't get more than 24 hours. How do you get more bang for your buck, out of the same 24 hours? That's why you need to Master the skill of Delegation! The above are all excellent ways to think - before you had employees. If you are an expert, and you wish to remain an expert, doing the hands on work, then the above way is the way you should be thinking.

You will learn: And you want: You will lose: Unhelpful thinking that have been holding you down :-( You will gain: New thinking that will catapult you to the next level!

After I mastered delegation by taking this class, my employees are happier and I can now focus on tasks that are more important for our long-term goals.""
