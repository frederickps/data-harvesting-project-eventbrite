Die vier Ch√∂re schauen gemeinsam nach Norden, Osten, S√ºden und Westen und zeigen die riesige Vielfalt der Chormusik, die im ganzen Land geschrieben wurde. Dabei tut sich nicht nur regional, sondern auch zeitlich eine enorme Spannweite vom Mittelalter bis in die Gegenwart auf. Ein besonderer Schwerpunkt des Programms liegt in der Musik zeitgen√∂ssischer Komponisten. Mit Yannick Wittmann und Rory Wainwright Johnston stehen zwei junge Berliner Komponisten auf dem Programm, die zugleich auch als Chorleiter zu sehen sein werden. Jede Himmelsrichtung wird durch ein von allen ca. 100 S√§nger:innen gemeinsam gesungenes St√ºck repr√§sentiert. Dabei bringen die vier Ch√∂re selten aufgef√ºhrte vierch√∂rige Musik zur Auff√ºhrung.

Heaux Tales, mo‚Äô tales‚Ä¶The Black Sex Worker Collective‚Äôs iconic ‚ÄúHeaux Tales‚Äù Black Sex Worker storytelling event is BACK and bigger than before! Back and still Black The Black Sex Workers Collective presents two nights of storytelling and performances by Black Sex Workers inspired by the seminal feminist text, ‚ÄòWomen Who Run With the Wolves‚Äô a novel which represents the instinctual nature of women by Clarissa Pinkola Estes. Join us for one or both nights as we sit around the proverbial fire to channel the wild femme spirit of divine Black folk. Our very special lineup includes new and seasoned performers, each of whom is a certified heauxstess with tha‚Äô mostest! This multi-media/intersensory experience aims to re-acquaint us all with our instinctual nature, where we tear apart systems of oppression which have taken us away from who we are. This showcase is an opportunity to join Black Sex Workers to reconnect with the wild spirit that lives within us! Due to stigmatization and the criminalization of sexual labor, Black Sex Worker narratives are often the missing component when we seek enlightenment and progression without our societies and ourselves. Regardless of your gende orgin or choice of labor, we present to you the opportunity to reconnect with your wild nature, as you experience the magic of Sex Worker artistry. The showcases take place at event space Studio DB in Wedding. With a sliding scale of 25-50euro euro, this show is easily accessible to most. [Black] Sex Worker groups are the most underfunded globally, you honor our time and energy by paying for a ticket‚Äîas Black people and as Sex Workers, we cannot work for free! With food on sale by the Jamerican (American and Jamaican soul food kitchen), a sober bar option, AND a dance party after the show, how could anyone miss this!

Unser 5. Film der kleinen aber feinen Filmreihe ist die DEFA-Kom√∂die Der Kahn der fr√∂hlichen Leute aus dem Jahr 1950 von Hans Heinrich. Die Filmkom√∂die spielt auf einem alten Frachtkahn. Nach einer Vorlage des Schriftstellers Jochen Klepper thematisiert der Film mit der jungen Schiffseignerin Marianne Emanzipation inmitten von Elbschiffern und Musikern.  In Zusammenarbeit mit Martin Koerber entstand die Idee zur Filmreihe. In den Geschichten wird abgeschleppt, was das Zeug h√§lt: Es schleppen M√§nner ihre Frauen und Schiffer ihre K√§hne ab, die Schiffe schleppen Schmuggelgut und Frauen schleppen Schiffer ab. Was die Filme eint ist, dass sie alle auf Schleppk√§hnen, also auf Paulas Schwesterk√§hnen, spielen. Die Besucher erwartet aber nicht nur eine Filmvorf√ºhrung in sch√∂nem und authentischem Ambiente. Als Highlight wird Martin Koerber vor dem Kino eine Einf√ºhrung zu dem jeweiligen Film geben und diesen filmgeschichtlich einordnen. Das kann er wie kein Zweiter, denn er war als Professor an der Hochschule f√ºr Technik und Wirtschaft der Experte f√ºr Konservierung und Restaurierung audiovisuellen und fotografischen Kulturguts. Au√üerdem leitete er viele Jahre das Filmarchiv der Deutschen Kinemathek. Die Paula ist ausgestattet mit einer Dolby-Surround-Soundanlage, so dass auf allen Pl√§tzen eine gute Akustik herrscht. Karten gibt es hier und an der Abendkasse. Nach dem Film laden wir zum Plausch an der Bar ein, und wer Lust hat, bekommt noch eine F√ºhrung durch die Paula. Die Geschichte: Das M√§dchen Marianne hat von seinen Eltern einen Motorkahn namens ""Eintracht"" geerbt und mit M√ºhe durchgesetzt, dass sie ihn zusammen mit ihrem Onkel f√ºhren darf. Mit dem neuen Maschinisten Michel gibt es gleich am Abend nach der ersten Fahrt Krach. Er geht - aus Eifersucht. Statt seiner nimmt Marianne drei lustige Musiker mit, die auf Arbeitssuche sind. Die Elbfahrt nach Hamburg endet zun√§chst auf einer Sandbank, von der sie ein anderer Frachtkahn, der ""Sturmvogel"", befreit. Dort hat Michel inzwischen angeheuert. Nach einigen Verwicklungen und grundlosen Schl√§gereien, denn Marianne ist l√§ngst in Michel verliebt, gibt es das verdiente Happy End. - 10.03.2024, 16 Uhr ‚Äì Der Kahn der fr√∂hlichen Leute DDR 1950, Regie Hans Heinrich, 91 Minuten Kom√∂die mit Elbschiffern, Musikern und Emanzipationsthematik  https://paula.berlin/#veranstaltungen",8,8,EUR,Kulturschiff Paula,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-10T15:00:00Z,2024-03-10T17:00:00Z,Kino auf der Paula - ABGESCHLEPPT: Der Kahn der fr√∂hlichen Leute,"Berlins sch√∂nstes Kiezkino zeigt im Rahmen der Filmreihe ABGESCHLEPPT die DEFA-Kom√∂die ""Der Kahn der fr√∂hlichen Leute"" - mit Einf√ºhrung",https://www.eventbrite.de/e/kino-auf-der-paula-abgeschleppt-der-kahn-der-frohlichen-leute-tickets-850350490207,berlin

NA,Sold out,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

They are hungry for knowledge, for wisdom, they want what's in your head, and they want you to make their learning experience inspirational not painful. If you refuse to teach them, if you are not effective at coaching, or if it's unpleasant to learn under you (you are a typical tyrant of a boss from 1950 LOL) they will quit and go somewhere else for the learning experience.

What is Reiki?Reiki (or Usui Reiki Ryoho) is a Reiki is a technique for stress reduction and relaxation that also promotes healing. It comes from Japan and has been passed down through generations, being practiced for the last 100 years. It is used for maintaining and restoring the health and wellness of the body, mind, and spirit.

Why Reiki?The most beautiful thing about Reiki, in my opinion, is that it is for everybody. You don‚Äôt need any prior knowledge or hundreds of hours of meditation.

Ich hatte Horror Phantasien, da√ü ich ihm mal begegnen k√∂nnte und habe bestimmte Orte gemieden um ihn nicht zu treffen. Nach einer von Christophs Radikale Ehrlichkeit Gruppen habe ich ihn dann einfach angerufen. Mittlerweile reden wir wieder miteinander und waren zusammen auf der goldenen Hochzeit von meinen Eltern. Mit meinem Vater hatte ich es fr√ºher oft nicht ausgehalten 5 Minuten zu telefonieren und jetzt machen wir zusammen Urlaub und ich war Weihnachten 4 Tage zu Hause. Ansonsten habe ich fr√ºher auch erwartet dass andere meine W√ºnsche erahnen und war oft heimlich w√ºtend und entt√§uscht. Seit Radikaler Ehrlichkeit habe ich das Selbstvertrauen einfach danach zu fragen was ich mir w√ºnsche. Danke Chris! Karen Koppitz ‚ÄûIch habe meine Sprache ge√§ndert und profitiere so krass davon!

Mich unter Druck gesetzt allen zu gefallen. Ein typischer ""Ja-Sager"".  Jetzt sp√ºre ich In mich hinein wenn ich rede. Ich habe meine Leichtigkeit wiedergefunden. Und mein ‚ÄûNein ‚ÄìSagen"" tut mir gut.‚Äù¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†  Der Kurs mit Selina und Christoph war eine der intensivsten und erkenntnisreichsten Erfahrungen die ich je machen durfte. Es hat mir gezeigt, dass jeder √Ñrger, jede Angst, jedes unangenehme Gef√ºhl vorbei gehen kann, wenn ich es mich sp√ºren lasse.‚Äù ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†  Uli Jung, Architekt aus Sch√∂nsee¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†  ‚ÄúIch bin selbst √ºberrascht von meinem Mut mich zu zeigen.

Egal ob mit Frauen, im Kampfsport, beim Meditieren oder sp√§ter als Vater, es ging immer darum alles richtig zu machen. Blo√ü nicht entt√§uschen!

11 days 4 hours,Mobile eTicket,NA,"Note: The exhibition is open on Tue-Wed and Fri-Sat, 15-19hThe exhibition doesn't have an opening event. ‚ÄãWelcome!""I look at the moment of painting, the minimum amount of time it takes. The object of the work needs to be the object of the gaze. It needs time for thought. Plans, observations and experiences wait for their moment and are condensed into colours, movement and shapes.However, doing things also needs time to think about the thoughts that come to mind or that the thoughts have time to form in the first place. When painting, you have time to feel what painting is to me. It's thought, play, humming, pungent mixing of colors. When I work with my hands, when I create something new, I ground myself in this being. Then I will know my place, whose right I am questioning at the same time.On display is a series of monotypes on used sheets, in which I study the absorption of colors into fabric and washing wrinkles, color overtones, and the role of light in colors when light penetrates a fabric hanging in the air. With monotype, I get to paint on a slippery surface and get the movement of painting involved in the process. This series of works started from the need for painting and my own space. I noticed that I seemed to be painting the space around me.""The exhibition is supported by the Finnish Cultural Foundation and the City of Oulu.Johanna P√∂ykk√∂ (b 1977) is a visual artist based in Oulu, Finland. P√∂ykk√∂ is studying the individual as part of a larger whole and the passage of time. For a long time, sheet fabric has been involved in making art as a material and as a transporter of information, a transmitter, and serigraphy as a technique. P√∂ykk√∂ creates textile-based installations and sculptures in which colours, lights and shadows create a spatial whole. P√∂ykk√∂'s works have been exhibited e.g. Oulu Art Museum, Forssa Museum, Kemi Art Museum and Craft Museum of Finland.***‚ÄúIch sehe mir den Moment des Malens an, die Mindestzeit, die es braucht. Das Objekt der Arbeit muss das Objekt des Blickes sein. Das Denken erfordert Zeit. Pl√§ne, Beobachtungen und Erfahrungen warten auf ihren Moment und werden in Farben, Bewegungen und Formen komprimiert.‚ÄãJedoch braucht es auch Zeit, Dinge zu tun, da man √ºber die Gedanken, die einem kommen, nachdenken muss oder damit die Gedanken Zeit haben, √ºberhaupt zu entstehen. Beim Malen habe ich Zeit, zu f√ºhlen, was Malen f√ºr mich bedeutet. Es sind Gedanken, ein Spiel, Summen, eine stechende Mischung aus Farben. Wenn ich mit meinen H√§nden arbeite, wenn ich etwas Neues kreiere, denke ich daran. Dann wei√ü ich, wo ich hingeh√∂re, w√§hrend ich das Recht darauf zur gleichen Zeit in Frage stelle.Die Ausstellung zeigt eine Reihe Monotypen auf gebrauchten Leint√ºchern, mit denen ich die Aufnahme von Farben in Stoffen, Waschfalten, Farbobert√∂ne und die Rolle des Lichtes in Farben untersuche, wenn Licht einen Stoff durchstrahlt, der in der Luft h√§ngt. Mit dem Monotyp male ich auf einer rutschigen Oberfl√§che und binde die Bewegung des Malens in den Prozess mit ein. Diese Werkereihe entstand, da ich ein Bed√ºrfnis nach Malen und meinem eigenen Raum hatte.

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.
