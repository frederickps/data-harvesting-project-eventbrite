2 hours 30 minutes,Mobile eTicket,No Refunds,"Three of the senior figures and leading improvisers in their respective countries, Swiss guitarist Christy Doran, Irish bassist Ronan Guilfoyle, and US drummer Gerry Hemingway come together to form an improvising supergroup of sorts, to explore the sonic and creative possibilities of the classic guitar trio format. Although all three had played with each other in various figurations, the genesis of the trio goes back to a legendary performance at the International Society for Improvised Music’s festival in Switzerland in 2015. Taking to the stage as a trio for the first time, and with no prior rehearsal, the group’s instant connection and sense of improvisational adventure swept all before them. Although all three have intensely busy careers working in various different projects, they agreed that they had to reconvene again to fully explore the possibilities revealed on that famous night in Chateau D’oex. The time has now comeand listeners can expect a kaleidoscopic exploration of guitar trio improvisation, featuring Christy Doran’s electric guitar mastery, Ronan Guilfoyle’s rhythmic intrigue, and Gerry Hemingway’s constant expansion of what drums are capable of in improvised music. Christy, Gerry and Ronan have just released their first album, ‘A Breath of Time’, on the Auricle Records label: https://auriclerecords.bandcamp.com/album/a-breath-of-time Christy Doran was born in Dublin and has lived in Lucerne, Switzerland since his childhood. His father was an Irish ballad singer. He has been a member of numerous ensembles, including OM, Christy Doran’s May 84 Septet, RED TWIST & TUNED ARROW. He also performs as a solo guitarist, and has played in duos with Marty Ehrlich, Dom Um Romao, Robert Dick and Ray Anderson among others. Christy Doran has toured in Europe, North-Africa, India, the Caribic, Mexico, the U.S., Canada, South America and Asia. He has given workshops in Switzerland, Austria, Estonia, Germany, Sudan, Cuba, Ireland, India, Bolivia, and the USA. He formed many groups of his own, f.e. Christy Doran´s New Bag (1997-2012), Christy Doran's BUNTER HUND, “Doran-Studer-Minton-Bates & Ali play the music of Jimi Hendrix”, “144 Strings for a Broken Chord”. Since 2014 he performs regularly with Christy Doran’s SOUND FOUNTAIN (with Lukas Mantel/dr and Franco Fontanarrosa/e-b). His music has been released by ECM, Synton, Planisphare, Hat Hut Records, On Cue Records, Creative Works, Konnex, UNIT, Intuition, Double Moon Records and Between theLines Records. In 2015 he released two new CDs: one an interpretation of the music of Jimi Hendrix (with Erika Stucky/voice, Jamaaladeen Tacuma/b, and Fredy Studer/dr) and the second a new CD of Christy Doran’s SOUND FOUNTAIN with new compositions by the composer. Both available on Double Moon Records/Challenge Distribution. Christy Doran was a co-founder of the Jazz School Luzern(now called Music University of Applied Sciences and Arts, jazz departement). In 2003 he was honored with the Art Prize of the City of Lucerne, Switzerland. Gerry Hemingway has been making a living as a composer and performer solo and ensemble music since 1974. He has led numerous groups, including (since 1997) his quartet with Ellery Eskelin, Herb Robertson and Mark Helias as well collaborative groups with Mark Helias & Ray Anderson (BassDrumBone) which celebrated its 30th year anniversary in 2007, Reggie Workman & Miya Masaoka (Brew), Georg Graewe & Ernst Reijseger (GRH trio), his duo w/Thomas Lehn, and also w/John Butcher. Mr. Hemingway is a Guggenheim fellow and has received numerous commissions for chamber and orchestral work including ""Terrains"", a concerto for percussionist and orchestra commissioned by the Kansas City Symphony. He also completed a production of “Songs”, two year recording project for the the German label, between the lines. He is well known for his eleven years in the Anthony Braxton Quartet, and his many collaborations with some of the world’s most outstanding improvisers and composers including Evan Parker, Cecil Taylor, Mark Dresser, Anthony Davis, George Lewis, Derek Bailey, Leo Smith, Oliver Lake, Kenny Wheeler, Frank Gratkowski, John Cale, Marilyn Crispell, Michael Moore and many others. Ronan Guilfoyle is a major figure on the Irish jazz scene and has developed an international reputation as a performer, teacher and composer. He began his career with Louis Stewart's group in the early 1980's and studied at the Banff Centre for the Arts in 1986 and 1987 where his teachers included John Abercrombie, Dave Holland, and Steve Coleman. Performing on the acoustic bass guitar since the early 1980s, Ronan is now one of the instrument's leading exponents, and is now much in demand as a bassist, both in his native Ireland and on the international jazz scene. Among the people he has performed with are Dave Liebman, Kenny Werner, Joe Lovano, Kenny Wheeler, Keith Copeland, Brad Mehldau, John Abercrombie, Larry Coryell, Benny Golson, Jim McNeely, Sonny Fortune, Andrea Keller, Andy Laster, Emily Remler, Simon Nabatov, Richie Beirach, and Tom Rainey. He has also been leading his own groups since the mid 1980s, and his groups have toured extensively in Europe, Asia, and North America. He has recorded extensively both as a sideman and as a leader and his output includes the award winning ""Devsirme"" in 1997. Ronan has been composing for classical ensembles since 1993, specialising in compositions which feature both improvised and written music. He has had great success in this field and has now a large body of work that ranges from solo piano pieces, to chamber works, to orchestral compositions. He has had commissions from a wide range of ensembles and organisations including the RTE Concert Orchestra in Dublin, The Opus 20 String Orchestra in London, and the European Jazz Youth Orchestra. He has also been commissioned to write works for many great soloists including the saxophonist David Liebman, the violinist Michael D'arcy and the virtuoso accordionist Dermot Dunne. Ronan has also acquired a formidable reputation as a composer in the world of contemporary jazz, and his music has been performed by such jazz luminaries as Dave Liebman, Kenny Werner, Kenny Wheeler, Keith Copeland, John Abercrombie, Andy Laster, Simon Nabatov, Richie Beirach, Tom Rainey, Julian Arguelles, Rick Peckham, and Sonny Fortune. In 1997 he won the Julius Hemphill Jazz Composition Competition in the United States. Over the past 10 years Ronan has become very well known for the teaching of advanced rhythmic techniques for jazz improvisation and his book, ""Creative Rhythmic Concepts for Jazz Improvisation"" which covers such areas as metric modulation and odd metre playing, is now seen as the standard text for this area. He has been invited to teach this subject at many schools around the world including Berklee College of Music, The New School, and is an associate Artist of the Royal Academy of Music in London, and has also lectured on it for the International Music Congress (UNESCO) in Copenhagen.

NA,Sold out,No Refunds,"Restorative Yoga provides a complementary space for both physical and mental relaxation. We can just be - with no agenda or expectation.  If you suffer from insomnia, stress, anxiety, whether your run down, worn out or are just super busy all the time and need a break.... This is for you! Restorative Yoga involves the use or props to support the body to completely relax. It is a way of really resting your body and allowing the body and mind to open up. Restorative Yoga can also be used as a meditation. We softly move our spines in different directions and include some gentle inversions which reduce our blood pressure. It stimulates and soothes our organs depending on the posture.  It is a quiet, slow practice - completely different to Yin Yoga in the sense that our use of props truly allows us to progress into deeper states of relaxation & opening. This allows us to get in touch with our body mind connection and puts us firmly on the path for relaxation, management and reduction of our stress. We move towards health and wellbeing. What’s not to love?! This is suitable for all levels including beginners. Prepare to unwind! Dress comfortably, bring a yoga mat, 3 blankets, 2 yoga blocks, a cushion, a yoga bolster if you have one - anything you need to help you be cosy a comfortable.

Welcome to the fastest-growing extreme sport in Ireland!Airsoft is a modern combat sport or recreational hobby in which participants eliminate opponents by hitting each other with spherical airsoft pellets launched from airsoft guns. Bring your own weapon or a rental option is now available. BOOK NOW Over 12's or we have a Family session on the 17th of March (Under 12s Welcome) Participants typically employ the use of varying types of weapons designed as replicas of real firearms. Tactical gear and accessories are also used to enhance the game and mimic equipment used by modern military and police organizations. Airsoft was developed in Japan in the late 1970s to provide an alternative for gun hobbyists because local laws prevented individuals from privately owning firearms. A heavy emphasis was therefore placed on making accurate replicas of real firearms the sport quickly swept through Asia as the de-facto extreme sport growing to a level far surpassing the level reached by paintball in the US. In contrast, Paintball was developed in the United States in 1981 as a variation of hide and seek tag through the use of utility companies paint marking guns, which were used to mark power utility poles. Paintball gained popularity throughout the 80s and early 90s as models became more intricate and realistic. Airsoft made its way to the US in the early 90s and was received as a less expensive and more intense alternative to the costly sport of paintball. Since then Airsoft has quickly gained greater popularity over Paintball due to its realism. low cost of operation. ammo. reliability and intense gameplay. Gameplay:Airsoft is based on the honor system!An honor system is employed whereby the players rely on each other's honesty to admit to being hit. Because unlike paintball the plastic pellets do not leave readily visible markings. Depending on the muzzle velocity of the gun and the distance from which a person is shooting the person on the receiving end of the shot will usually feel a slight pain in the area of impact.What do I need to get started?First and foremost you will need safety equipment!We recommend using a full-face ASTM-rated safety mask to prevent injury.You will need to select your primary weapon. Most players select their Rifle first as this will allow them to start playing right away.There are three main types of Airsoft guns:Automatic Electric Gun (AEG)Gas Powered(Gas Blow Back and Gas Non Blow Back)Springers.

Donegal. Suitable for all skill levels, this experience is a fantastic introduction to both cable knitting techniques & traditional Irish design. Aran cable knitting originated off the west coast of Ireland within the boundaries of its namesake home, the Aran Islands – a neat group of Gaeltacht isles nestled in the cold, restless waters of the Atlantic; their history long, rich & holding tight to an Irish-speaking status to this day. It is here that the ‘Aran Jumper’ hails from, this notable knitwear incorporating the very techniques this course will pass on to you. Aran hand-knitting has unfortunately fared less well in this modern world, seeing a decline that demands attention. In the spirit of preserving and promoting a niche piece of Irish heritage, this experience aims to share this longstanding hand-knitting technique; specialty sourcing the original Aran knitwear Irish wool from Ireland's only native sheep breed, The Galway, to serve as our core material.

NA,Sold out,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

Your business competitors are not only working on stealing your customers away from you, they are also working on stealing your best employees from you. You are competing against other employers to attract and keep high quality employees. And your best employees? In this knowledge based economy, best employees know the key to their own long term well-being is their own skill set. They are hungry for knowledge, for wisdom, they want what's in your head, and they want you to make their learning experience inspirational not painful. If you refuse to teach them, if you are not effective at coaching, or if it's unpleasant to learn under you (you are a typical tyrant of a boss from 1950 LOL) they will quit and go somewhere else for the learning experience.

Since 1994 when Stevan began teaching IET® he asked the angels to help spread IET beyond its origins in New Jersey to New York, or even New England. The angels have done this and more. Today there are IET students in 75 countries including Australia, Croatia, Hungary, Denmark, Guatemala, Nepal, Slovenia, Sweden, and Uzbekistan. We are truly honoured and blessed by what the angels (and the IET Master-Instructor Earth Angels) have done. Basic Level Our Basic Level Integrated Energy Therapy® Training class: Prerequisites: This is our entry-level class and there are no prerequisites required for attendance at this class. Description: Even though we call this class “basic level” this class provides you with everything you need to do a powerful Integrated Energy Therapy® session on yourself or on another person (either in person or absentee). This class has been designed to be a wonderful entry level class for those students wanting to use energy therapy to heal their lives, an ideal class for students wanting to begin an energy therapy practice, and it provides a wonderful complement to other holistic techniques such as Massage, Reiki, and Therapeutic Touch. Only IET Master-Instructors are authorized to teach this class. Basic Attunement: You will receive a special Basic Level “energy attunement” that will permanently open your energy field to the power of Integrated Energy Therapy® Basic level ray. Our Basic Level attunement expands, realigns, and restructures the 1st pair (physical) and 2nd pair (emotional) of your 12 Strand DNA. Once attuned to the Basic Level IET Ray, you will have the ability to clear cellular memory of physical and emotional blockages. Angelic Heartlinks: Integrated Energy Therapy® is known as “Healing with the Energy of Angels”. You will learn to access the energy of angels through a simple yet powerful process that we call a Heartlink. A “heartlink” is a connection made with the angelic realm in which you visualize a golden chord going from your heart, through your throat, up through your head and then up to the angelic realm or to a specific angel, usually Angel Ariel or one of the other “Healing Angels of the Energy Field”. Once your Heartlink has been established, you will learn how to send love up to the angelic realm or that specific angel and you will find that the love returned is multiplied from the angels to further assist you in the healing of yourself or others. This Heartlink is invaluable in and of itself, however, when it is used in conjunction with the accessing of the energy system, it becomes extremely powerful and effective. The Magic Presence by M. DaCamara, copyright 1942 St. Germain Press, is a good depiction of a Heartlink Clearing Cellular Memory: you will learn about the nine cellular memory areas where we can unconsciously store “issues in our tissues” that can negatively affect our life. More importantly, you will learn simple yet powerful techniques to get the issues out of your tissues (as well as out of the tissues of others). Clearing of cellular memory is made quick and easy by means of nine sets of Integrated Energy Therapy® Integration Points that allow you to energize, integrate, and clear the nine cellular memory areas. Special Empowerment Imprints: In Integrated Energy Therapy® clearing harmful energy blocks is only half the task. After energy blocks are cleared, you will learn to channel angelic energy to form an empowerment imprint that fills the cellular memory with the opposite of what you cleared. For example, you will learn to clear the energy of guilt and imprint the energy of innocence. Class Length: 1 day (approx. 8 hours). This class is designed to be taught in one day, and typically runs from 9:30 AM to 5:30 PM. The actual length and times of class vary by individual Integrated Energy Therapy® Master-Instructors. Class Materials: you will receive a fully illustrated 26 page Integrated Energy Therapy® Basic Level Guide and an official Integrated Energy Therapy® Basic Level Certificate. Intermediate Level Our Intermediate Level Integrated Energy Therapy® Training class: Prerequisites: Completion of the Integrated Energy Therapy® Basic Level class is required for attendance at this class. Description: This class is the next step in our Integrated Energy Therapy® training system and it builds on all of the knowledge and techniques learned in our Basic Level training. Our Intermediate Level training expands upon both the depth and the breadth of the Basic Level techniques through the Intermediate Attunement (which opens you to clear mental and karmic imprints) and through the special Integrated Energy Therapy® pullout-release technique that lets you clear imprints from the human energy field. Only IET Master-Instructors are authorized to teach this class. Intermediate Attunement: You will receive a special Intermediate Level “energy attunement” that will further open your energy field to the power of Integrated Energy Therapy® Intermediate Level ray. Our Intermediate Level attunement expands, realigns, and restructures the 3rd pair (mental) and 4th pair (karmic) of your 12 Strand DNA. Once attuned to the Intermediate Level IET Ray, you will have the ability to pull physical, emotional, mental, and karmic energy imprints out of the human energy field. Clearing The Human Energy Field: You will learn the special Integrated Energy Therapy® pullout-release technique that will turn your hands into “energy magnets” that will allow you to easily attract and clear harmful energy imprints from the human energy field. This will allow you to clear even more difficult energy blockages. As part of this training, you will also be taught to feel and interpret energy blockages and identify the level (physical, emotional, mental, or karmic) that the energy blockages occur. You will also learn the special “pink bubble technique” that will further accelerate the clearing process. Class Length: 1 day (approx. 8 hours). This class is designed to be taught in one day, and typically runs from 9:30 AM to 5:30 PM. The actual length and times of class vary by individual Integrated Energy Therapy® Master-Instructors. Class Materials: You will receive a fully illustrated 26 page Integrated Energy Therapy® Intermediate Level Guide and an official Integrated Energy Therapy® Intermediate Level Certificate. Advanced Level Our Advanced Level Integrated Energy Therapy® Training class: Prerequisites: Completion of the Integrated Energy Therapy® Intermediate Level class is required for attendance at this class. Description: This class builds on all of the knowledge and techniques learned in our Basic and Intermediate Level trainings. While our Basic and Intermediate Level classes are focused on clearing cellular memory and the human energy field, our Advanced Level training is focused on helping you live your soul’s mission and bringing your dreams alive. Only IET Master-Instructors are authorized to teach this class. Advanced Attunement: You will receive a special Advanced Level “energy attunement” that will further open your energy field to the power of Integrated Energy Therapy® Advanced Level ray. Our Advanced Level attunement expands, realigns, and restructures the 4th pair (soul profile) and 5th pair (soul cluster) of your 12 Strand DNA. Once attuned to the Advanced Level IET Ray, you will have the ability to discover your soul’s mission and attract members of your soul’s cluster to help you live your soul’s mission and bring your dreams alive. Your Soul’s Mission: Every soul incarnates with a special mission that is not only perfect for that soul but is an integral part of the higher divine plan. The Advanced Level energy attunement will open you to a deeper connection with your 8th chakra (called the soul star) where the complete plan for your soul’s mission is stored. You will learn how to tap into the soul star energy and better understand your soul’s mission through the creation of a vision board. You will also learn about the four E’s of living your soul’s mission and how energy blockages can prevent you from living your mission. Muscle Tension – Relaxation Techniques: The deep energy blockages that can prevent you from living your soul’s mission can easily be released through the special Advanced Level Integrated Energy Therapy® muscle tension – relaxation techniques. These techniques applied to the arms and legs will accelerate you in the living of your soul’s mission. Soul Star Clearing: This Advanced Level technique lets you work directly with the 8th chakra to activate the energy of the soul’s mission and focus angelic energy to bring your dreams alive. Heartbeams – Healing the Earth: As an Advanced Level practitioner, you will be able to give back to Mother Earth by establishing columns of Integrated Energy Therapy® energy into the Earth called Heartbeams. Once established, these columns provide a permanent anchor of angelic healing energy into the Earth. These can be used to heal areas of the Earth that have suffered from human or natural devastation. Not only will Heartbeams offer healing to the Earth, but they will also offer healing to anyone who passes through them. As an Advanced Level Integrated Energy Therapy® practitioner, you can place Heartbeams in your home and office. You can also place them at the entrances to schools, hospitals, train stations, airports, and anywhere lots of people will pass through. Class Materials: you will receive a fully illustrated 34 page Integrated Energy Therapy® Advanced Level Guide and an official Integrated Energy Therapy® Advanced Level Certificate.

Traversing past and present and deeply rooted in a sense of place, The Dining Club sees chefs Kelly Keogh (Whitestown House) and James Gabriel Martin (Leviathan) curating dining events with a focus on seasonality, heritage and story-telling. Each one is unique, designed around a theme, with changing menus, entertainment, and table settings. Whitestown House Estate, nestled near The Naul in North County Dublin, is set on 125 acres of farm and parkland. The historic demesne has remained intact since the 1600s and has a long and storied history of hospitality, marking it as the perfect venue for our events. The house was designed for entertaining. Guests are welcomed into the drawing room for pre-lunch champagne cocktails and canapés. The legendary long table in the dining room can accommodate up to 18 guests, and by its very design encourages connection and conversation. In the winter months, candlelight and crackling open fires bathe all of the rooms in a warm, welcoming glow. In the spring and summer months we host woodland gatherings beneath an ancient fern-leaved beech tree on the property and have picnics on the lawn. A Champagne Luncheon As the springtime light begins to brighten the land and the days become longer, we invite you to join us for an intimate and engaging lunchtime event, the very first of its kind for The Dining Club. Guests will first be greeted with champagne cocktails and canapés, as well as live music to set the mood.

The Game of Knowledge"". Leela's philosophy is a quintessence of Vedic knowledge. The ancient yogis, after exploring the maze of human mind, identified 72 initial states of being and consciousness, and these states correspond to the 72 boxes of the game of Leela. The most ancient game of self-knowledge, Leela, is a gift for every human being on the path. By using this game as a mirror of real life, you can save many years. Years that you would have spent searching for the path that brought you into this incarnation, that made you incarnate. The Game of Leela is a self-discovery tool that allows you to "" test the route "" and, if necessary, to adjust your direction of movement. Leela is one of the systems of self-knowledge, a way to know life and the laws of the Universe.

Our ability to use our mind determines how well we can control our external realities. What you may not know is that our Minds have an identity. Creating an Identity of mind allows us to direct our external world intentionally. The language we use to run our lives is one dimensional, which creates needless limitations. Our minds work best in a multidimensional language. Learning how to access your minds resources correctly will enable you to create a life beyond who we desire to be. Our vocabulary, are words we use internally to motivate change, but instead of encouraging us, the imperfections in our speech and articulation restrict access to our minds. There is no synchronicity between the one-dimensional language in our speech and the 4 th dimension of the mind. If you’re not using the correct language of the mind, the mind disengages where we become confused. We don’t have the language to describe the life that we want in a way that the mind accepts, understands, and can utilise.

 its political artworks, the Republican Memorial Garden and the world famous mural of Bobby Sands. This tour tracks the course of the “Peace Wall” and goes through Clonard with its famous Clonard Monastery
 Church and Bombay Street, the epicentre of events in 1969. The group will be then handed over to the
 loyalist tour guide who will bring it on to the Shankill Area, to hear the unionist/loyalist perspective on our
