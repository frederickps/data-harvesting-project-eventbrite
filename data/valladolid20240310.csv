NA,Sold out,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!
