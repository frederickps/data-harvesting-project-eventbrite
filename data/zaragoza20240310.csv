Diversos estudios han demostrado la relación directa entre el cuerpo (postura, estado general de las articulaciones y los músculos, buen funcionamiento de los órganos internos) y los estados mentales y emocionales. Somos seres integrales en los que todos nuestros sistemas están interconectados. Aprender a construir un cuerpo más fuerte y más flexible te puede proporcionar beneficios a todos los niveles. Reducir la sensación de cansancio, mitigar o eliminar dolores articulares, mejorar la postura… además de construir una mayor conciencia de nuestro cuerpo (propiocepción) y de cómo los estados del cuerpo nos afecta a los estados mentales y emocionales (interocepción). Aprenderemos y practicaremos ejercicios concretos de movilidad de caderas y de columna vertebral de la mano de Pilar Sánchez, experta en movilidad y Profesora de Vinyasa Flow y Pilates en el Centro. Además, al finalizar la sesión teórico-práctica, disfrutaremos de un brunch mientras compartimos con Pilar y entre las/los asistentes las dudas o comentarios que tengamos.

I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone.

The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.
