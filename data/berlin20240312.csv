NA,Contact the organizer to request a refund.,"ABOUT THIS TICKET This ticket is for a one-off taster class to try out the experimental figure drawing workshop. For those wishing to continue, successive sessions can then be booked. WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION The workshop, which takes place as a series of classes, is called as such because of its exploratory nature. It serves as a space for development and discovery, where individuals engage in artistic exploration and growth. This journey is an experimental introduction to figure drawing for complete beginners to intermediate level. You will discover how to relate to and draw the human body in an investigational way, rather than through classical methods. Through the course, you will learn about using materials that suit your individual style. Materials used in both dry and wet techniques can be soft pastels, charcoal, ink, a variety of pencils, and brushwork. History of art will be integrated into the course and directly influence the sessions, creating a basis for you to discover your unique artistic talent. Basic general information about human anatomy is provided, though the course is not based on a classical method. We will use printed material and no live model will be present. My teachings will be just the start of your own personal application and purpose. The classes are going to be in groups of maximum 5 people, to create an intimate work space and for me to dedicate enough time to each person. Each session will end with a discussion, exchange of ideas, and feedback on the learning process. ABOUT SALVATORE SICILIANO, THE WORKSHOP TUTOR The workshop is based on Salvatore's artistic approach to the human figure and it has the goal to make you discover your uniqueness and talent. Salvatore's experience in choreography and painting is the ground he will utilize to lead the workshop and to explore the beauty of the human body with you. ""Painting is impactful, but drawing is intimate, drawing is home"". Salvatore pursued fine arts at Accademia di Brera in Milan, coupled with dance and choreography at Accademia Susanna Beltrami. During his studies in Milan, he collaborated as a choreographer and visual artist with NABA Milano, Istituto Europeo di Design Milano, and Ansaldo Space Fashion and Design. Since 2012 he worked as a dancer throughout Europe and in 2015 he founded Siciliano Contemporary Ballet (SCB) in Berlin. Salvatore’s work is a mix of drawing and painting, the composition is strongly influenced by his knowledge of dance and choreography.

It will be soft, joyful, and focused. The ATM lessons happen in a group setting, with students following the verbal instructions of the teacher. Very often laying on our back, sometimes sitting, we will go through gentle movement sessions of 45 to 60 minutes. From these sessions, we will continue our exploration through somatic dance work, focusing on the relationship of our weight with the floor and our three dimensionality in space, reaching a precise attention to our sensations. By becoming more aware of our self-image and the possibility to expand it, we will use imagination to move and improvise. By doing so, we will allow new movement possibilities to arise, and achieve more functionality in moving. During this series of shared practice, we will sometimes also experiment with vocal integration and observe how we sound to find more freedom and ease with our voices. Sessions build on one another and we recommend attending the whole series, which can be booked here. However, each session can also be booked and attended individually. The series is open to everybody and you are encouraged to be exactly how you need to be at the moment! Nothing to bring except loose and warm clothes. Blankets, mats, water & tea will be provided. If you have a special physical condition you would like to talk about beforehand, do not hesitate to reach out and we will find the best way for you to feel comfortable in participating. In case you can't afford a regular ticket but would love to attend anyway, please send us a message (hi@b23.berlin) and we'll find a solution. *The Feldenkrais® Method of somatic education uses gentle movement and directed attention to help people learn new and more effective ways of moving. You can increase your ease and range of motion, improve your flexibility and coordination, and rediscover your innate capacity for graceful, efficient movement. Since how you move is how you move through life, these improvements can enhance your thinking, emotional regulation, and problem-solving capabilities. About the facilitator Pauline Payen (they/she) is a choreographer, performer and Feldenkrais® practitioner. She studied art and dance in ISDAT Toulouse in France (2003-2006) and in HZT Berlin in Germany (2016-2028). She completed her training at the Feldenkrais Education Center of Aurillac, France, in 2023. In recent years, Payen developed a particular attention to psychological sound techniques such as Musak, super-charged-positive-affirmations and binaural beats. Between 2017-2019 she worked for Brazilian choreographer Xica Lisboa’s research “Melt” developing the attention to facial movements through the practice of “Moving-Image-Awareness”. In 2019/2020 she works for choreographer Antje Velsinger in “dreams in a cloudy space” a duo with a 75 years old dancer. Since 2020 she has developed research on the topic of grief, somatics and empowerment and created the piece HIGH TIDE. Her last piece, Yahoo! Dance!, is rooted in voice and movement scores researching the impact of the internet news feed on our psyche and bodies. Beside working as a performer and creating her own choreographic work, Pauline teaches workshops of Feldenkrais® and somatic movement and regularly collaborates as outside eye, dramaturg, artistic companion, seeking for alternative and sustainable ways to create support in the community.

At the end of the Second World War, Germany’s fate was decided during the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences: Germany was split among the Allied Forces. Consequently, Berlin was also divided between Soviet Russia (East Berlin) and England, USA, and France (West Berlin). The split through the heart of the city led to constant tensions, protests, and increasingly higher numbers of East Berliners fleeing the GDR (German Democratic Republic) through West Berlin.

Mind ReMapping You may read this today and wonder, what values can we learn from Mind ReMapping? Your Mind is an atomic and perpetual energy. Its power is so complex that it carries no mass, but yet, derives energy not only from the natural sustainability of surrounding environments, but it perpetuates far greater power with the connections it makes with other minds where at our collective nucleus, is a nuclear energy which is unstoppable. This power, which for most of us is dormant, inspires its own potent energies, deriving power from genuine and respectful gestures we gift through the interactions we have with one another, in the simplest of, “Hellos, & how are you?” Its only through a connection with other minds, not money, nor possessions, that can pull us out of our lowest moments in life’s darkness, because nothing, not even FEAR, can survive the deep depths of Time, where FEAR abandons us to insanity or, we find salvation through a connection with other minds. However, the mind's energy when synchronised is unrivalled, as there is nothing more gargantuan than collective minds coming together because the mind must first perceive before it can conceive. Collective Minds that are empathic to one another are designed to create wormholes in Time, where either the greatest ideas are birthed, or where our worst nightmares are channelled through time. Wormholes in Time, of course, can be achieved in their singularities which can be truly exhilarating or horrific, but the wormholes we create together, open vaster passages in Time through which powers of Consciousness can manifest itself to us, in whatever we have asked it to become. That power to some, can present itself to be God, to some, it can be Spirituality, and to others, it can be the Sciences, the Arts, or any means where Consciousness can reach us through OPEN TIME. Imagine these wormholes as transmission gateways to higher or lower Dimensions, that for humans, are situated in the only place where Time can travel, whilst carrying our perceptions with it. That place is the 4 Dimensions of our Minds. At this point, we realise why our minds are so powerful because they are PORTALS of TIME, and why, we are often kept divided, pitting advantages against one another over trivial conflicts, because we have forgotten who we are. We are not aware we are lowering our status as a species which redirects Times energy toward alternative sources that close time, straining and weakening mind transmissions. However, what is being attempted above all our own primitive needs, is that certain Timelines of Consciousness are being fragmented. Consciousness is an intelligence of unities, where strength in numbers creates infinities which either, flourish in life, or instead, are infinities that perpetuate repetitive downward spirals. The next revolution is not going to be the takeover of A.I. as we are sold and told because it is too obvious, it instead, will be the invisible Decimations of minds only looking out for themselves, or it will be the Raptures of people who know their Minds, bringing Times of life, together.

NA,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

The container provides opportunity for deep reflection, accounability and compassionate challenge. This is a safe space where all emotions are welcomed; where we encourage each other to face our shadows and get brutally honest with ourselves; where we voice our intentions and feelings earnestly; and where we compassionately hold each other accountable to becoming better versions of ourselves. The intention of the group is to provide a constructive container where men can cultivate healthy masculine embodiment. This happens best when the group deepens trust with one another over time and holds each other accountable for doing the inner-work. The more committed and regular the attendance, the more power the container becomes. PLEASE ARRIVE 5 MINS EARLY SO WE CAN START ON TIME There is also the opportunity to go in the sauna afterwards for 15€ (cash). This is a great opportunity to socailize and establish deeper connections with members. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Men are often expected by society, their family and work place to hold it all together and be strong. While there is certainly times and places when it’s good to be so, without the necessary tools and spaces, it’s all too easy for men to internalized their struggles and emotions. This leads to the epidemic of mental crisis in men. On top, men today are more alone than ever, starved of real connection. There’s a big difference between connecting with a group of male friends down the you watching the footies, making stabbing jokes masked as ‘banter’, to actually showing care and concern and offering the space to truly open up how one is feeling. This group not only offers the chance to enhance connection with other men and to process your emotional world more effectively, but offers the tools and practices that’ll allow you to embody your masculinity on a deeper and more consistent level. The world today is starved of genuine, healthy masculine role models. The social-political landscape has made is more confusing than ever to know how to be a ‘man’, and has led to an epidemic of nice-guys. Yet, there is a huge movement rising up teaching men to embody what is really need for society, families and partnerships - teaching men confidence, leadership, values, resilience and emotional intelligence (whilst staying clear of red-pill ideology!) _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This mini-workshop series is held by Fred, a men’s embodiment coach and bodyworker.

NA,Contact the organiser to request a refund.,"In this busy, modern world, many of us unconsciously breath too fast. This often may lead to us feeling stressed, anxious and unbalanced. Pranayama (Sanskrit for ""the regulation or control of the breath"") focuses on breathing techniques that help you gain more consciousness over your natural breathing patterns. This can support you in slowing down your breath. Breathing in a calmer pace helps you quiet your mind and supports your parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for your ""rest and digest“ response and helps you generate feelings of calmness and relaxation. This class combines breathwork techniques with a sound journey using Tibetan singing bowls to help bring calmness and relaxation. The class will focus on slowing down breathing through techniques like Tulku and Hamsa breathing, as well as heart resonance breathing. The second part of the class offers a sound bath using the soothing vibrations of Tibetan singing bowls and other therapeutic instruments. This class is taught by Emmeline, a certified breathwork and meditation teacher and sound healing practitioner who discovered the benefits of these practices in her own healing journey and now aims to support others in connecting with their inner self through sound, breath, and cacao.

And just like that, someone else has also already asked themselves the very same questions that we are asking ourselves right now. The actors change, but the scenarios repeat and oftentimes it is by seeing someone else enduring them, that we forgive ourselves for our own similar experiences. As woman or members of the LGBTQIA+ community, we often face challenges that we can't always fully perceive, or fully forgive ourselves for how we have dealt with them. In this circle curated by Bia (07.L3), we will be creating a safe space to face all of it. We will take out any dirty laundry and share our stories. And grow together while making upcycled art with nail polish! The participants will be invited to pick an object from a pool of items brought by each one of us and the artist themselves. We will then sit in a circle and give our objects a makeover using nail-polish and, if we feel like it, we can take care of our nails too! All while sharing our experiences and sipping on some drinks.

2 Stunden,NA,"„Sachkunde statt Kuscheltierdrama – über Tierschutzprobleme in der Heimtierhaltung"" - neue Veranstaltungsreihe der Berliner Landestierschutzbeauftragten & des Berliner Tierschutzvereins Nicht nur in Berlin, sondern deutschlandweit ist die Lage in den Tierheimen dramatisch. Die Aufnahmekapazitäten sind ausgereizt; oftmals sind die Tierschützenden am Ende ihrer Kräfte und das Geld ist knapp. Der Grund dafür ist die Masse an Heimtieren, die während der Corona-Pandemie unbedacht angeschafft wurden und nun die Boxen und Gehege fluten. Dabei ist wichtig festzuhalten, dass der Großteil dieser Tiere nicht aus deutschen Tierheimen stammt, sondern aus dem illegalen Welpenhandel, von Onlinebörsen oder aus nicht seriösem Auslandstierschutz. Auffangen muss die z.T. aggressiven, schwer verhaltensauffälligen Tiere, allen voran Hunde, aber auch Katzen, bei uns das Tierheim Berlin. Daher veranstalten die Berliner Landestierschutzbeauftragte und der Tierschutzverein Berlin gemeinsam eine Veranstaltungsreihe rund um das Thema richtiger Umgang mit Heimtieren. Wir wollen aufzeigen, wie falsche Tierliebe mit typischen Haltungsfehlern zu großen Tierschutzproblemen führt.

I watch the movies every year for Christmas and read all the books multiple times. As a Stand-Up comedian, I wrote several nerdy jokes on Hogwarts, Dumbledore and the Sorting Hat... ...but the audience often doesn’t even know what any of that means! Can you believe it?!? Crazy, right?!? 🤯 For this reason, I wanted to organize a show exclusively with people who love, understand and want to laugh about the world of Harry Potter 😊 At the show, I’ll do MOSTLY Harry Potter material and mix in some other funny stuff as well.

2 hours 30 minutes,NA,"It is all about Meme Coins & Vibe in the Polkadot Ecosystem including their artwork and message. Starting with a base introduction to the technical terms, you will be joining our panel discussion about disruptive topics followed by an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session. You might have heard: What is a memecoin? It is a term used to refer to cryptocurrencies named after characters, individuals, animals, artwork, or anything else that can be mimicked. Most are supported by enthusiastic online traders and followers and are generally intended to be light-hearted and fun. While meme coins may be entertaining to some, they are also highly risky investments and may hold little or no intrinsic value. Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and other currencies that may offer more entertainment than usability fall into this category. When buying or trading meme coins, it’s critical to understand the risks to help you avoid unexpected volatility and losses. About the Web3Rdy Team:We are especially looking to help people without technical backgrounds and those with them who aren’t familiar with Blockchain.Are you interested in Blockchain technology but don’t know where to start? Have you been to other Events but are overwhelmed by technical details? Have you ever asked yourself, Blockchain, but what does it do?We want to help answer all of these Questions and more.

Individuelle oder kollektive Maßnahmen? Flexitarier werden oder Second-Hand kaufen? Ihr Haus renovieren oder mit dem Fahrrad zur Arbeit fahren? Sich in einem Verein oder an Ihrem Arbeitsplatz engagieren? Haben Sie schon immer davon geträumt, einen Schritt zurückzutreten und sich ein Weltszenario für einen Übergang zu einem kohlenstoffarmen Leben vorzustellen? Was wäre, wenn Sie nicht nur als Einzelperson, sondern auf globaler Ebene Maßnahmen ergreifen könnten, an denen alle Länder und großen Unternehmen beteiligt wären? Würden Sie es schaffen, die Ziele des Pariser Klimaabkommens zu erreichen? Dieser Workshop ist genau das Richtige für Sie, wenn Sie auf konkrete und spielerische Weise verstehen wollen, was nötig ist, damit unsere Gesellschaft im Jahr 2050 kohlenstoffneutral wird. Gemeinsam mit anderen Teilnehmern bilden Sie ein Team, dessen Aufgabe es ist, ein Übergangsszenario zu erstellen, um den Klimawandel auf +1,5°C zu begrenzen. Zu diesem Zweck werden Sie sowohl individuelle als auch kollektive Maßnahmen für die nächsten 30 Jahre wählen und dank unserer Live-Simulation nach jeder Entscheidungsrunde sehen, welche Auswirkungen Ihre Entscheidungen haben und wie sich Ihr Übergangsszenario dem Ziel für 2050 nähert. Am Ende des Workshops werden Sie einen Überblick darüber haben, was ein Übergang zum Netto-Null Energieverbrauch in Bezug auf die zu priorisierenden Maßnahmen auf verschiedenen Ebenen bedeutet und welche Akteure und Sektoren davon betroffen sein werden. Dank Ihres Teilnehmerkontos werden Sie die Vielfalt der möglichen Maßnahmen und das Ausmaß ihrer Auswirkungen entdecken.

NA,NA,"Please, read this description till the end before you come to the event. Thank you very much! given by Regina LoMío (dance teacher, facebook.com/reginalomio ) organized by LoMío (facebook.com/lomiosi) This a private event, so you don't need to say you are interested on individual dates here. If you truly are interested, please, send me (Regina LoMío: lomiocontact@gmail.com) a message for or about a session request. Dance is not just the art form in which movement is provoked by and/or synchronized with music and sounds, it is also a (very human) way to express feelings, mental states, identities in a way akin to (social) body language, for instance. To dance well you need technical prowess, confidence, imagination, and sense of context. The last three are psychologically relevant categories which define aspects of the personality and also are constantly affected by the person's mental/emotional health. Dancing is not just dancing. Dancing can be much more than just movements. In this event we will approach the act of dancing as deliberately ritual, transcendental, indeed mindful. In a ritualized setup, like in the traditional rites associated to ancient cults and cultures, dancing can be a healing tool when coupled with conscious cultural learning and mindful techniques. There is the possibility to work on dance and movement patterns that would be suitable to anyone willing to improve their body-mind connection, indeed their psychological/neurological well-being. We intend to do so through promoting self-expression, a healthy balance between non-inhibition and self-control, body positivism, rhythmical prowess, movement coordination, movement synchronization and movement independence (distinguishing from body parts, e.g., arms, legs, head) when dancing to polyrhythmic music, conscious psychological and/or cultural identification with the subject and imagery of the music and the context (dance rite); and, whenever possible, we will aim at reaching transcendental and spiritually relevant states of the mind beyond the actual dance. Each session is appropriate for either only one client or up to a maximum of five (5) persons at the time. I will offer three different styles: Afro Cuban (link to previous event: https://fb.me/e/18ejz25ji) Techno-based (link to previous event: https://fb.me/e/1AzZbsW7j) free-style (link to previous event: https://fb.me/e/4umj0WFbh) with diverse popular music of choice It is totally up to you (a person or a 5-heads group) which style you would like in your session, and in fact, you can experience all in the same single session or alternate between the styles through more than one session. Just notify in advance per e-mail or private message here in Facebook about your preferred event settings. The ritual dance sessions would allow us not just to work on the appropriate dance/movement patterns but also verbal feedback and conversations on the topics of emotional/mental health relevant to you, as well as the exchange of music, video, and literature material that you wish to obtain. Water, tea, and eventually self-made non-alcoholic fermented beverages will be served and free of any charge. Session plan (persons, pricing, and inscription): The event is designed in a flexible manner allowing sessions involving from one to five persons per session. There will be three different kinds of session plans regarding the number of attendees, payment method, and inscription deadlines. - Plan A: for just one individual who would pay 40 EUR per hour (a 120-min (2-hours) session will cost 80 EUR) and you can request 1 hour, 1 hour 30 minutes, or 2 hours of dance session. Only cash will be accepted when you pay on arrival or during a session. You can book a session up to three (3) days prior to your desired date, and you can cancel anytime via e-mail or phone should you not make it. - Plan B: for a maximum of five (5) people, who would possibly be befriended/acquainted (eg. close friends, job colleagues) in advance and would whenever possible request the 2-hours session and transfer the payment of 75 EUR via PayPal or bank transfer jointly as a group. You can also split the transfers (for instance, 15 EUR per person) specifying the date and time of the session in your transfer. In any case you (as a group) need to do so at least ten (10) days ahead of your desired date, so that the transfer would be confirmed by me at least one week before the session. Refund only possible until five (5) days before the session and then if two (2) of you have to cancel and request refund the session would be cancelled unless the remaining three (3) want to pay 75 EUR jointly or 10 EUR more per head. Finally if on the day of the session some cannot attend the event would still go ahead even if it is with only one client. - Plan C: for four (4) to five (5) not necessarily related persons who notify attendance three (3) days in advance and pay 25 EUR on arrival but take the risk that if less than three (1 or 2) attend the event is cancelled, unless they want to pay 75 EUR jointly on arrival. This means that if I receive a request for a date where someone else already booked a Plan C session, I would add persons to that date until there are five potential attendees. All of you will receive a notification from me about the planned session and whether or not there are at least four (4) people enrolled, which is the minimum required in this case to confirm the session's occurrence. I will also make a choice of music, dance style, and emotional/spiritual themes after talking to all the attendees and getting a feel of what best would suit the whole group, i.e. a sort of conscious addition and/or common denominator result of all of your interests together. Otherwise If you request a Plan C session on a date where someone else already booked a Plan A (individual) session I would then ask that person whether it is ok that you attend their session. If they agree you'd pay only 25 EUR for the 2-hours session while the person who originally requested the individual session pays 50 EUR (instead of 80 EUR) and still gets to decide which music, dance style, and/or emotional/spiritual themes we will addressed in the session. You can also just split the 75-EUR fee and make it a truly shared 2-persons session if you wish so but the choice of dance/music style and themes would have already been defined by the person who originally requested the individual session. I will constantly post on the event's discussion which dates already are booked and through which plan and style, though not at all by whom. Hygienic measures: Available sanitary conditions will be provided so you can wash hands, and windows will be open several times to ensure the room is well aired. Please, beware it may not be suitable for you if you are allergic to cat hair. Level: Level-independent Inscription and dates: Just send a private message to LoMío's facebook page or an e-mail to Regina LoMio (LoMío) lomiocontact@gmail.com. Provide a phone number through which I could contact you (preferably smartphone's apps like Signal or Telegram). Once we are in contact through phone I would share the address with you and we can arrange a dance date and a payment method according to your prospected plan (see above, A, B, or C). Available dates are Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Saturdays between 16:00 and 21:00, which means you can arrange a dance date either 16:00-18:00 or 19:00-21:00 on any of these days. Outfits: Training outfits, sports wear, or similar. Language: English (German or Spanish on request). Address: Indoors, somewhere in the Viktoriapark neighborhood.

NA,NA,"The Tagore Centre, @indiaingermany invites all to a show of kathak Dance : Krishna Geetham. Kathak is a prominent ancient Indian classical dance and is thought to have started from the wandering bards of North India known as Kathakars, meaning storytellers. These Kathakars travelled and conveyed stories by means of music, dance and songs. Samvedan - The Deodatt Persaud Kathak Studios will be presenting an evening dedicated to the enchanting Lord Shri Krishna. Through the captivating classical dance form of Kathak, the presentations will illuminate the life and essence of Shri Krishna using poetry and texts from various Indian saints and philosophers. The performance will portray episodes ranging from Krishna's playful and mischievous interactions with the milkmaids (gopis) to the divine dances with his beloved Shri Radherani. At the heart of the evening's presentation lies the Raas Leela, narrating the timeless bond between Krishna and his devotees. This narrative encapsulates the universal theme of love with his devotees and underscores the profound truth that the interplay of masculine and feminine energies within a sea of love and devotion holds transformative power.

NA,NA,"Ganz im Stil der seit nunmehr 16 Jahren stattfindenen Hidden ChampionsTour präsentieren wir Ihnen Top-Fonds aus der Produktpalette der HANSAINVEST, die als Spezialist für Boutiquen-Fonds gilt. Bekannte Fonds, zu denen es interessante neue Informationen (bspw. zu einer Strategierweiterung) gibt, im deutschen Retailvertrieb noch weitgehend unbekannte Fonds, die die vor noch gar nicht langer Zeit innovativ an den Start gegangen sind oder Fonds, deren herausragende Entwicklung bislang noch nicht publik wurde - alle Fonds sind sorgfältig selektiert und sind es wert, in jeweils einer halben Stunde bei der HANSA ChampionsTour einem breiten Publikum aus Finanzanlage-, Honorar- und Bankbertern, Haftungsdach-Tied Agents, Vermögensverwaltern, Familiy Offices und sonstigen (semi)institutionellen Gästen präsentiert zu werden. Wie immer werden unterschiedliche Konzepte vorgestellt, die einander im Anleger-Portfolio bestens ergänzen können. Wenn absehbar ist, dass Sie nicht teilnehmen können, so können Sie jetzt schon die Informationen (Präsentationen, Fondsmanager-Interviews von Mein Geld-TV etc.) anfordern. Schicken Sie einfach eine kurze Mail an info@aecon-gmbh.de. Wenn Sie sich bereits angemeldet haben, jedoch verhindert sind, so melden Sie sich bitte so früh wie möglich über Ihr Eventbrite-Profil ab. Die Informationen zu den einzelnen Gesellschaften erhalten Sie dann automatisch. Einfach nicht zu erscheinen, ist keine gute Idee, denn wir richten die Raumkapazität und die Bestellung von Snacks in den Kaffeepausen sowie das Buffet an der Zahl der angemeldeten Teilnehmer aus. Sie wissen, dass Lebensmittel, die demzufolge übrig bleiben, vernichtet werden müssen, weil der Gesetzgeber noch nicht einmal erlaubt, die örtliche Tafel damit zu versorgen. Sorgen Sie deshalb durch Ihre Abmeldung dafür, Verschwendung zu vermeiden. Da Sie sich aber in der Regel anmelden, um dann auch zu erscheinen, wünschen wir Ihnen schon jetzt eine gute Anfahrt. Kostenlose Parkplätze finden Sie übrigens direkt hinter dem Hotel. Freuen Sie sich auf eine tolle Veranstaltung. Wir freuen uns auf Sie! Hier ein kurzer Überblick auf die sechs Fonds, die wir Ihnen in diesem Jahr präsentieren: Absolute Return, Aktien, Anleihen, Edelmetalle, Immobilien, Liquidität, Private Equity, Rohstoffe, Wald- und Agrarinvestments und Wandelanleihen – der „antea“ (ANTE1A) ist ein wirklicher Multi Asset-Fonds, der von sechs voneinander unabhängigen Fondsmanagern gesteuert wird. Der Fonds und seine bis ins Jahr 2007 reichende Ergebnishistorie ist bekannt. Neu – und einmalig – ist die Beimischung von am Zweitmarkt erworbenen Gesellschaftsanteilen geschlossener Immobilienfonds. Wie das funktioniert und welche Renditechancen damit einhergehen, wird bei der HANSA ChampionsTour im Detail erläutert werden. Website: www.antea-ag.de Der „APUS Capital ReValue“ (A1H44E) investiert in wachstumsstarke, innovative europäische Unternehmen, die mit neuen Produkten, strategischer Neuausrichtung und veränderter Rahmenbedingungen die Gewinner des permanenten Wandels unserer Gesellschaft und Wirtschaft sein werden. Ein konsequenter fundamentaler Investmentansatz und die Fokussierung auf reine Einzeltitelselektion unter Berücksichtigung von Megatrends und deren Profiteuren bilden die Basis dieses stark fokussierten Aktienfonds. Bei der HANSA ChampionsTour erhalten Sie einen Einblick in die Selektionsmethodik des erfahrenen APUS Capital-Teams. Website: www.apuscapital.de Mit dem „proud@work“ (A2PRZX) soll ein nachhaltiger Wertzuwachs durch die Investition in Unternehmen erzielt werden, deren Unternehmenskultur dafür sorgt, dass sich die Mitarbeiter mehr einsetzen – weil sie stolz auf Ihre Arbeit und Ihr Unternehmen sind. Selektiert werden diese Unternehmen auf Basis der Erkenntnisse von „Great Place to Work®“, einem in weltweit 57 Ländern tätigen Forschungs- und Beratungsinstitut. Die Untersuchung von Unternehmen, die ihre Mitarbeiter besser behandeln, hat eindeutig ergeben, dass diese Unternehmen – gemessen an ihrer Kursentwicklung – langfristig erfolgreicher sind. Website: www.punica-invest.de Beim „BRW Balanced Return“ (A2H7N9) deuten sich Veränderungen an, auch wenn die Strategie des bereits im Jahr 2013 aufgelegten Fonds grundsätzlich beibehalten wird. Wie bisher wird die Aktienseite nach dem bewährten und mehrfach ausgezeichneten Konzept des Braunschweiger Vermögensverwalters gemanagt. Auf der Anleihenseite kommt, statt der bisherigen Drittfondsstrategien, neuerdings ein hauseigener Ansatz zur Anwendung, der so am Markt noch kaum zu finden ist. Der Fonds, der zu Unrecht im Retail-Vertrieb noch wenig bekannt ist, sollte damit aus dem Schatten der bekanntlich erfolgreichen BRW-Fonds treten. Website: www.brw-ag.de Der ""IIV Mikrofinanzfonds"" (A1H44T) war der erste seiner Art, der auch Privatanlegern offensteht. Er wurde bei den Boutiquen Awards in drei verschiedenen Kategorien als Sieger ausgezeichnet - kein anderer Fonds schaffte dies bislang. Trotzdem ist vielen Anlegern und Beratern nicht bewusst, dass sie mit ihren Investitionen gleichzeitig Existenzgründer in den ärmsten Ländern der Welt mit Mikrokrediten unterstützen können. Wie der Fonds insgesamt funktioniert, wie die Überwachung der aktuell rund 466.000 Einzelkredite erfolgt und viele weitere interessante Informationen gibt es bei der HANSA ChampionsTour. Website: www.investinvisions.com Der „Wallrich AI Peloton“ (A2JQH3) verkauft Put-Optionen auf den EuroStoxx 50, um Optionsprämieneinnahmen zu generieren. Je höher die Markt-Volatilität, desto höher sind die Prämieneinnahmen. Es werden positive Renditen in steigenden, seitwärts laufenden und leicht fallenden Märkten erzielt. Das Optionsportfolio wird mittels eines quantitativen Modells gesteuert, dessen zugrunde liegender Algorithmus mittels künstlicher Intelligenz optimiert wurde. Menschliche Emotionen sind damit ausgeschlossen. Der Fonds darf auch in Anleihen investieren. Die Wertentwicklung betrug in den letzten 3 Jahren über 30 %.

NA,NA,"Join us on the 12th of March at 18:30 to celebrate the release of No Judgment: Essays by Lauren Oyler. Lauren will be joined by the writer Ben Mauk. The conversation is followed by an after-party in the store! Books and wine will be available for purchase throughout the evening. RSVP is required! Please get your ""free ticket"" from below.About No Judgment:From the national bestselling novelist and essayist, a groundbreaking collection of brand-new pieces about the role of cultural criticism in our ever-changing world. In her writing for Harper’s, the London Review of Books, The New Yorker, and elsewhere, Lauren Oyler has emerged as one of the most trenchant and influential critics of her generation, a talent whose judgments on works of literature—whether celebratory or scarily harsh—have become notorious. But what is the significance of being a critic and consumer of media in today’s fraught environment? How do we understand ourselves, and each other, as space between the individual and the world seems to get smaller and smaller, and our opinions on books and movies seem to represent something essential about our souls? And to put it bluntly, why should you care what she—or anyone—thinks? In this, her first collection of essays, Oyler writes with about topics like the role of gossip in our exponentially communicative society, the rise and proliferation of autofiction, why we’re all so “vulnerable” these days, and her own anxiety. In her singular prose—sharp yet addictive, expansive yet personal—she encapsulates the world we live and think in with precision and care, delivering a work of cultural criticism as only she can. Bringing to mind the works of such iconic writers as Susan Sontag, Pauline Kael, and Terry Castle, No Judgment is a testament to Lauren Oyler’s inimitable wit and her quest to understand how we shape the world through culture. It is a sparkling nonfiction debut from one of today’s most inventive thinkers. Lauren Oyler is a critic and novelist based in Berlin, Germany. Her essays on books and culture appear regularly in the New Yorker, the New York Times, Harper’s, the London Review of Books, and many other publications. Her debut novel, Fake Accounts, was published in 2021. A new collection of essays, No Judgment, will appear in March 2024.Ben Mauk is a writer based in Berlin.

11 days 4 hours,NA,"Note: The exhibition is open on Tue-Wed and Fri-Sat, 15-19hThe exhibition doesn't have an opening event. ​Welcome!""I look at the moment of painting, the minimum amount of time it takes. The object of the work needs to be the object of the gaze. It needs time for thought. Plans, observations and experiences wait for their moment and are condensed into colours, movement and shapes.However, doing things also needs time to think about the thoughts that come to mind or that the thoughts have time to form in the first place. When painting, you have time to feel what painting is to me. It's thought, play, humming, pungent mixing of colors. When I work with my hands, when I create something new, I ground myself in this being. Then I will know my place, whose right I am questioning at the same time.On display is a series of monotypes on used sheets, in which I study the absorption of colors into fabric and washing wrinkles, color overtones, and the role of light in colors when light penetrates a fabric hanging in the air. With monotype, I get to paint on a slippery surface and get the movement of painting involved in the process. This series of works started from the need for painting and my own space. I noticed that I seemed to be painting the space around me.""The exhibition is supported by the Finnish Cultural Foundation and the City of Oulu.Johanna Pöykkö (b 1977) is a visual artist based in Oulu, Finland. Pöykkö is studying the individual as part of a larger whole and the passage of time. For a long time, sheet fabric has been involved in making art as a material and as a transporter of information, a transmitter, and serigraphy as a technique. Pöykkö creates textile-based installations and sculptures in which colours, lights and shadows create a spatial whole. Pöykkö's works have been exhibited e.g. Oulu Art Museum, Forssa Museum, Kemi Art Museum and Craft Museum of Finland.***“Ich sehe mir den Moment des Malens an, die Mindestzeit, die es braucht. Das Objekt der Arbeit muss das Objekt des Blickes sein. Das Denken erfordert Zeit. Pläne, Beobachtungen und Erfahrungen warten auf ihren Moment und werden in Farben, Bewegungen und Formen komprimiert.​Jedoch braucht es auch Zeit, Dinge zu tun, da man über die Gedanken, die einem kommen, nachdenken muss oder damit die Gedanken Zeit haben, überhaupt zu entstehen. Beim Malen habe ich Zeit, zu fühlen, was Malen für mich bedeutet. Es sind Gedanken, ein Spiel, Summen, eine stechende Mischung aus Farben. Wenn ich mit meinen Händen arbeite, wenn ich etwas Neues kreiere, denke ich daran. Dann weiß ich, wo ich hingehöre, während ich das Recht darauf zur gleichen Zeit in Frage stelle.Die Ausstellung zeigt eine Reihe Monotypen auf gebrauchten Leintüchern, mit denen ich die Aufnahme von Farben in Stoffen, Waschfalten, Farbobertöne und die Rolle des Lichtes in Farben untersuche, wenn Licht einen Stoff durchstrahlt, der in der Luft hängt. Mit dem Monotyp male ich auf einer rutschigen Oberfläche und binde die Bewegung des Malens in den Prozess mit ein. Diese Werkereihe entstand, da ich ein Bedürfnis nach Malen und meinem eigenen Raum hatte. Ich bemerkte, dass ich den Raum um mich herum malte.”​Die Ausstellung wird von der finnischen Kulturstiftung und der Stadt Oulu unterstützt.Johanna Pöykkö (geb. 1977) ist eine bildende Künstlerin aus Oulu, Finnland. Pöykkö studiert das Individuum als Teil eines größeren Ganzen und in dem Ablauf der Zeit.

Pöykkö kreiert textilbasierte Installationen und Skulpturen, bei denen Farben, Lichter und Schatten ein räumliches Ganzes bilden.

And a big part of what you have to teach, is wisdom, insights, human nature, understanding of business. Good economy, bad economy, bad employees are dime a dozen. Good employees? Your business competitors are not only working on stealing your customers away from you, they are also working on stealing your best employees from you. You are competing against other employers to attract and keep high quality employees. And your best employees? In this knowledge based economy, best employees know the key to their own long term well-being is their own skill set. They are hungry for knowledge, for wisdom, they want what's in your head, and they want you to make their learning experience inspirational not painful. If you refuse to teach them, if you are not effective at coaching, or if it's unpleasant to learn under you (you are a typical tyrant of a boss from 1950 LOL) they will quit and go somewhere else for the learning experience.

In this class, I learned how to identify the best timing for coaching! ""The effectiveness of my coaching improved dramatically, after taking this class with Coach Michael Lin.
