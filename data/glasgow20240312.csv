Ever wondered about the magic behind those plush carpets and intricately designed textiles? Look no further ‚Äì welcome to the world of tufting! What is Tufting? Tufting is an age-old textile technique that involves the creation of intricate patterns and designs by punching yarn through a fabric base. It's the art of crafting textures and bringing creative visions to life through the careful placement of each tuft. What You'll Learn: In this workshop, we'll unravel the mysteries of tufting, guiding you through the essential techniques and tools. From understanding different tufting styles to hands-on practice, get ready to explore the fascinating realm where precision meets artistry. Why Tufting Matters: Beyond its historical significance, tufting has evolved into a dynamic craft that blends tradition with innovation. It's not just about creating textiles; it's about expressing creativity, adding warmth to spaces, and pushing the boundaries of design. Who Should Attend: Whether you're a seasoned textile professional, a DIY enthusiast, or someone simply curious about the world of tufting, this workshop is for you. No prior experience is needed; just bring your eagerness to learn and create! PLEASE NOTE: THIS EVENT IS ONLY AVAILABLE FOR 18+ YEARS OLD.

We've all been to them... the awkward, uncomfortable, salesy events where you listen to one scripted elevator pitch after another.

It is speculated that microdosing could improve performance at work, stimulate creativity, alleviate symptoms of depression or anxiety and enhance cognitive function. Yet the scientific community is currently debating the evidence on microdosing being able to elicit real effects. Is it objectively enhancing productivity, creativity and mental health, or is it a placebo? This talk is going to explore the latest evidence regarding the mechanisms and effectiveness of microdosing in a range of scenarios. Doors open at 6.30pm, talk starts at 7pm - come down early to grab a good seat! Follow us on IG @seedtalks Mourad is a senior registrar in psychiatry, currently working with the Regional Affective Disorder team in Newcastle (part of the Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Trust (CNTW)).

He is the lead for the psychedelic service in Newcastle which is currently in development after taking part in its first project investigating psilocybin for treatment resistant depression.

I started playing piano when I turned 19 and I discovered the 60's Jazz and I fell in love with the Piano of Bill Evans. His romantic and melodic touch led me to gorgeous places, and evoked my introspective and existential thoughts. In 2011 I was living in London and I bought myself my first piano and I started learning scales and tried mimicking some of my favorite Jazz tunes by ear. Time passed and for years piano was nothing but my friend and companion in my privacy, I used to improvise all night long just for the pleasure of telling stories to myself or a few friends that were coming over. Until in 2016 I came to Scotland and I started meeting friends to Jam and improvise together. In 2019 I started recording a piano Album but COVID came and I gave up the project. During Covid I started learning guitar, since my obsession with Brazilian and classical guitar was gargantuan. In 2021 I was playing with a friend who eventually introduced me to the members of Groove Down and later in 2023, I started a project called Fingertraps. Since then, I have been aiming to blend my most beloved genres of World Jazz, Classical and Latinoamerican music. I feel like music is a living organism and I want to learn and play different genres and apply different techniques, blending them and pushing myself to go to uncharted places.

NA,Contact the organiser to request a refund.,"When: fortnightly on Tuesdays, 19:00-22:00. Check Eventbrite or The Salisbury Centre website. How to attend: please make you sure you book via Eventbrite - we're introducing this now to keep our booking simpler and collect enough donations to cover the room hire. 100% of the donations (minus the booking fee) go to The Salisbury Centre. The group is open to everyone, both regular members and one-off visitors. If you have a question, email authenticfredsc@gmail.com Room: Art Room, occasionally in the Garden (if the weather is good) Suggested donation: ¬£5-10 (please find more information on how to donate at the end of this page) Accessibility: Art Room is located on the ground floor and it is fully accessible. Studio is not accessible yet. The Salisbury Centre‚Äôs kitchen door and toilet are now wheelchair accessible. The Garden can also be accessed by wheelchairs via a movable ramp via the Art Room Annex. The Authentic Connection Group, also known as ‚ÄúAuthentic Fred,‚Äù is a community-run, experimental space where we practice the art of relating. We do it through playing Authentic Relating games, learning about consent, Circling, and exploring other practices that bring us closer to ourselves and each other. Our two keywords are ‚ÄúAuthentic‚Äù and ‚ÄúConnection‚Äù. Authentic, because we believe in staying true to your experience and expressing it in a skilful way to others, rather than pretending you‚Äôre feeling / thinking something else. Connection, because we value staying in connection with ourselves and others, no matter what our experience is at any point. We draw a lot on Authentic Relating games, inspired by Sara Ness and the work of Authentic Revolution work. At the same time, we‚Äôre open to all practices that have to do with connection, communication, and relationships. Each session is different and unique. However, we do have our roots in foundational practices such as The Noticing Game and Circling. Our informal motto is this quote from Fred Rodgers, an American TV host and author: ‚ÄúAnything that‚Äôs human is mentionable, and anything that is mentionable can be more manageable. When we can talk about our feelings, they become less overwhelming, less upsetting, and less scary. The people we trust with that important talk can help us know that we are not alone.‚Äù Please book your spot via Eventbrite. At this time, we‚Äôre keeping the spaces limited to 20 people (not including the facilitators) due to the room size and the nature of what we‚Äôre doing. This ensures a quality experience for everyone. After you‚Äôve come for a few times and feel more comfortable in the group, you‚Äôre very welcome to take lead, too. This can mean facilitating (or co-facilitating) one of the sessions, taking on replying to email for a few weeks, or writing our bi-weekly newsletter. All of this is optional but highly encouraged! üôÇ The group relies on the contributions of the members and is co-created by all. Our agreements are signposts for the group‚Äôs culture. They help us know what to expect in the group (both from ourselves and others) and through that, create a space in which we can feel safer to explore edgy relational territory. We always revisit the agreements at the beginning of the session. You can read through them out here at any time. Here‚Äôs the short version: Participation in our community-led events is often on a voluntary ‚Äòby donation‚Äô basis. This means that nobody is expected to make a payment if they cannot afford to do so. However, any donations received for the Authentic Connection Group will be passed on to The Salisbury Centre, helping to make the events‚Äô programme sustainable. Where a ‚Äúsuggested donation‚Äù is listed, this is just an indication of what the event might cost if it was ticketed ‚Äì it is fine to donate less (or nothing at all). Donating is one way to show your appreciation for the value of the Salisbury Centre. Please consider ‚Äòpaying it forward‚Äô by donating a bit extra if you can afford, helping to keep it possible for everyone to take part, regardless of their circumstances. Suggested donation for this event is ¬£5 - 10. To donate: This is an invitation to practice ‚ÄòDana‚Äô (generosity) ‚Äì please pay only what you can afford to attend.

Hidden conflict is easy to miss and therefore can be particularly damaging. Ultimately, this is likely to have an adverse effect on team and company performance, costing time and money. It is therefore vital to manage conflict constructively. As a team member and leader, your ability to deal with and resolve conflicts defines your success in the longer term.

Local community collect plastic for us and afterwards we sort it into types and colours, shred it and then using an Extruder machine invented by Precious Plastic we can really do pottery out of it.

The session will involve a brief introduction to some basic methods and rules for safe working in the Studio, followed by plenty of time for you to discover your inner recycle potter. It could be a bowl, a pen mug, a candle holder, a sculpture ... if you can imagine it, we will do our best (together) to make it happen.

NA,NA,"Join Justin O‚ÄôConnor for a launch event for his forthcoming book ‚ÄòCulture is Not an Industry‚Äô, published by¬†Manchester University Press. Culture is at the heart to what it means to be human. But twenty-five years ago, the British government rebranded art and culture as 'creative industries', valued for their economic contribution, and set out to launch the UK as the creative workshop of a globalised world. Where does that leave art and culture now? Facing exhausted workers and a lack of funding and vision, culture finds itself in the grip of accountancy firms, creativity gurus and Ted Talkers. At a time of sweeping geo-political turmoil, culture has been de-politicised, its radical energies reduced to factors of industrial production. This book is about what happens when an essential part of our democratic citizenship, fundamental to our human rights, is reduced to an industry. 'Culture is Not an Industry' argues that art and culture need to renew their social contract and re-align with the radical agenda for a more equitable future. Bold and uncompromising, the book offers a powerful vision for change. Justin will be joined by Katrina Brown, Abigail Gilmore, and Robert Hollands to discuss the book and the role of culture in the future, particularly in the context of the climate crisis, and questions of cultural policy as we face a UK General Election in the near future. The panel discussion will be chaired by Mark Banks, with Kate Oakley chairing the book discussion.

For Scotland to meet its net zero targets by 2045, the way buildings are heated needs to change.

This ambition poses a complex challenge, considering that almost a third of Scotland‚Äôs population is currently living in fuel poverty.

1 hour,NA,"Exploring youth perspectives on well-being through photovoice. What well-being support do young people need from Scottish youth work after COVID-19? by Haley Sneed This research aims to explore young people‚Äôs well-being priorities and how youth work in Scotland can better support their ability to take action to address those priorities, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study employs a qualitative methodology within a participatory paradigm based on constructivist beliefs. This paradigm relies on a collaborative researcher-participant relationship that is emancipatory and transformative in nature and facilitates the creation of co-constructed knowledge (Howell, 2013). This research utilises the methods of photovoice, photo-elicitation, an open-ended questionnaire, and semi-structured interviews. The co-creation of knowledge through photovoice and photo-elicitation will help to diminish power relationships by meaningfully engaging participants with academia, research, and relevant stakeholders within their local community. This study actively opposes tokenistic engagement and will encourage participants to be curious about their experiences while learning to lobby for change. The literature provides strong evidence that the detrimental impacts of the pandemic have hit young people hardest out of any group (Hagell, 2021; Leavey, Eastaugh, & Kane, 2020). It has deeply intensified poverty, impacted employability and education outcomes, and hindered well-being (Bynner et al., 2020; The Scottish Government and COSLA, 2019; The Scottish Government, 2021). Youth work services articulate that they have been significant in supporting young people throughout COVID-19 and its aftermath (UK Youth, 2021; Youth Scotland, 2020; YouthLink Scotland, 2020), but young people‚Äôs views are missing. This research addresses a gap in the literature by exploring the experiences of those young people whom COVID-19 has most detrimentally impacted. This talk will present examples of the participants‚Äô perspectives through photographic data and accompanying written narratives. Additionally, it will discuss data concerning the participant-led coding and reflexive thematic analysis process. Lastly, it will present findings and conclude with the study's outcomes. Decolonising Environmental Literacies for Regenerative and Sustainable by Sundas Mahar FuturesAbstract: Indigenous and traditional literacies about the natural environment are often overlooked within mainstream discussions on sustainability. During this presentation I will share my motivations for my PhD research project and the progress I have made so far - I facilitated 3 research workshops each at the University of Glasgow and the Woodlands Community Development Trust. The workshops explored the use of indigenous and traditional literacies and lenses of viewing the natural environment, to respond to modern sustainability challenges. I also asked the same questions, within an adapted online version, from colleagues around Africa - this was done in place of in-person fieldwork that could not be made possible. During the workshops, I used participatory approaches that included arts-based methods, Ketso mind-maps and Sharing Circles. I will be sharing the background, the theoretical and methodological approach, and some of the results from the study during the presentation.",0,0,GBP,"PGR Community Team, School of Education, University of Glasgow",https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-12T12:00:00Z,2024-03-12T13:00:00Z,PGR-Led Seminar,A time of coming together and celebrating our community and where we are on our PGR journies!,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pgr-led-seminar-tickets-856335541657,glasgow,NA

1 hour,NA,"Supportive outdoor environments can enable people to remain healthy and active in older age, improving quality of life. Yet older adults continue to face difficulties accessing physical environments. This seminar presents emerging findings from a longitudinal study of older people (aged 50+) living in Scotland, UK, 2021-23, and explores how physical environments support people to undertake the ‚Äòpersonal projects‚Äô (Little, 1983) that enable them to flourish. Personal projects are self-generated and purpose-oriented activities an individual is doing or planning to do, and range from important everyday routines to ambitious, long-term endeavours. Drawing on data from 45 participants, we describe the types of personal projects participants reported as important and what aspects of the environment were associated with project enjoyment and positive outcome. Projects that involved social engagement with other people and their local community were valued highly. Concerns about safety and fears of falling or an accident were however a significant deterrent to spending time in natural environments. Overall, the easier the local outdoor environment made it for people to carry out their personal projects, the higher their quality of life; this is particularly important in a post-COVID world. We examine the significance of these findings in the context of policies and frameworks concerning ‚Äòage-friendly communities‚Äô to address the role of the physical environment in not only supporting people to achieve the necessary tasks of daily living adequately, but also in supporting people and communities to flourish in later life. About Dr Caroline Pearce Dr Caroline Pearce is a Research Fellow in the Edinburgh School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture (ESALA) and the Advanced Care Research Centre. Her current research explores the role of outdoor environments in supporting people to live well and flourish in older age. Previously, Caroline was a Research Associate at the University of Cambridge from 2019-2021 and King‚Äôs College London from 2017-2019. She completed her PhD on recovery following bereavement at The Open University in 2016. *Please note that this webinar will be recorded* This event is taking place both in person and online.

The Decline and Fall of the British Raj seeks to fill this gap as a project that brings in not just the rupture and drama of 1947, with partition of the Indian Empire and consequent creation of the new states of India and Pakistan, but the chaotic and ever-changing story from the eve of World War I when India's future and form was hotly debated. This lecture gives a glimpse into one of the greatest episodes in global history. Biography Dr Harshan Kumarasingham is Reader in Politics and History at the University of Edinburgh. His work covers British, Imperial and Commonwealth politics and history. Kumarasingham was recently awarded the FW Bessel Prize from the Humboldt Foundation given to ‚Äòinternationally renowned academics from abroad in recognition of their outstanding accomplishments in research to date and their exceptional promise for the future‚Äô for his work on legacies of Empire and constitutional studies.

2 hours,NA,"‚ÄúScientist Rebellion‚Äù produced a graph that charts the steep increase of parts of CO2 per million over the past half-century, and it marks the series of international conferences and agreements along the way, from the first World Climate Conference in 1979 (336 ppm) via the first IPPC Assessment Report in 1990 (354 ppm) to the Paris Agreement which, adopted in 2015 (401 ppm), pronounces the goal of limiting global warming to 2ÀöC or better 1.5ÀöC when compared to pre-industrial levels (about 280ppm). As the graph moves to the present, its colour stripes indicate raising global temperatures, leading to the present increase of already 1.3ÀöC. The graph illustrates what is clear to see all around: carbon emissions have continued rather unabated and fossil fuels have not gone anywhere. Lawyers of an idealistic bent might react that the law has just not been effective enough, the targets not ambitious and the commitments not hard enough. Others, of more critical inclinations, might sigh and point out that, of course, the law has been complicit all along because it is tied up with extractive capitalism and anthropocentric worldviews. What the graph suggests across the board is an erosion of legal normativity, either because the law is not effective or because it got the preferences all wrong and prioritises profits over the planet. The present paper investigates this erosion of legal normativity from different vantage points and probes related legal practices and doctrines in the context of the climate crisis, ranging from doctrines of desuetude via practices of civil disobedience to climate litigation and the recognition that, still now, ‚Äòrenewal repeats‚Äô.

1 hour 30 minutes,NA,"Indirect communication is important in Japan, where, as in other Pacific societies, it may be positively rude to speak too directly. This language is not easy to learn out of context, but various material means have been devised to make unspoken communication quite clear, and some of these are also examples of Japanese arts and crafts. The talk will be based on Joy's research in various parts of Japan, including her study of politeness which long ago became a book about wrapping culture. She will illustrate her talk with photographs. About the speaker: Joy Hendry is Professor Emerita of the Social Anthropology of Japan, Oxford Brookes University, founder of the Japan Anthropology Workshop and the Europe Japan Research Centre. She carried out fieldwork in Japan over 45 years, including research on politeness which inspired her interest in non-verbal communication. She has published many books and articles, including the regularly updated textbook Understanding Japanese Society, and a publication related to the talk entitled Wrapping Culture: Politeness, Presentation and Power in Japan and Other Societies, which she wrote while working with Professor Gow at the Scottish Centre for Japanese Studies at Stirling University.

Look through the Glen and the discover the Glenfinnan Viaduct, imagine upon it the Jacobite steam train. The wisps of smoke left behind as it takes the students back to Hogwarts. The beautiful Loch Shiel then becomes the Black Lake, beneath its waters an entirely new world of its own.  Are you ready to climb the Monuments winding steps? Emerge into the light onto a platform, 60ft above the shoreline. Taking in some of the very best views of the Scottish Highlands.

NB: each waiting list entry is for ONE TICKET only, so please make a separate registration for each ticket you would like. THEME: Creating Tomorrow Our special guest for the late show will be Alice Fogg, Community Development Officer at Highlands and Islands Climate Hub working across Badenoch & Strathspey, Nairn, Inverness, and Inverness-shire. She grew up in Lincolnshire, and has been gradually migrating north ever since, studying in Durham before making her home in beautiful Grantown on Spey two years ago. Whilst studying Geography at university and working in a community bookshop, Alice gained a huge appreciation for the power and value of community action. She has started and supported a range of community initiatives around mental wellbeing, mutual aid, and music. Alice thrives when building relationships with communities and channeling energy and creativity to facilitate community-led climate action. Outside of work you can find Alice playing flute, clarinet and saxophone in local music groups, wild swimming, learning G√†idhlig, bird-watching and sipping flat whites (hopefully not all at the same time!). Inspired by Alice's work and that of the climate hub, the theme for both our early and late shows in March will be 'Creating Tomorrow'.

In doing so, you can speed up a young person‚Äôs recovery and stop a mental health issue from getting worse. Our courses won't teach you to be a therapist, but we will teach you to listen, reassure and respond, even in a crisis - and even potentially stop a crisis from happening. But more than that, we aim to give you the information and skills to look after your own mental health so that you can set an example for young people. By giving you the tools to have these conversations, we hope to empower you to create a mentally healthy, supportive environment in your family, school, peer group or community. Let's create a future where mental health is treated as a normal part of life, in the same way as physical health. A future where every young person has access to support if they need it.""
