Then this event is for you! On 14 March 2024 we will meet at Evolution Cascais-Estoril Hotel for Portugal's first Wellbeing Education Summit We are hosting two identical sessions so that everyone can join at a time that works with their schedule.  9:30 - 11:30 am Morning Session 19:00 - 21:00 pm Evening Session Why should you join? Mental health challenges appear to be growing, so prioritising children‚Äôs wellbeing and wellbeing education is essential. Wellbeing forms a child's foundation for their future success and happiness. A child‚Äôs physical, emotional, social and mental health are interconnected and play vital roles in their overall development. By actively fostering their wellbeing education, parents can help themselves and their children build resilience, cope with challenges and develop healthy relationships. Additionally, a focus on wellbeing enhances academic performance, as children are better able to concentrate and learn. Promoting wellbeing at a young age establishes lifelong habits that contribute to a fulfilling and balanced life, and we are never too old to add tools to our toolkit. You will gain an insight to the practical skills available to actively impact your child's wellbeing. Key note speaker:‚Ä® Meet Sue¬†Langley who¬†is a global expert on the practical application of emotional intelligence, positive psychology and neuroscience. Her expertise in sharing knowledge and facilitating learning enables people to add tools and strategies that go beneath some of the quick fixes we may read about. This event will enable everyone to assume responsibility for increasing wellbeing education across all aspects ‚Äì children, parents, school and community. And the research shows that increasing your knowledge of wellbeing leads to increases in wellbeing. https://langleygroup.com.au/ Hosted by:  Sarah Bonnett - 25 years‚Äô experience of teaching in primary, middle and high schools across North America and Europe¬†and now a specialist in Positive Education. She is the founder of Higher-Stronger Happier that delivers custom-made programmes based on the science of wellbeing, and specialist guidance for parents.

2 horas,NA,"Session of the Development Studies Seminars 2024 with Lena Rethel (University of Warwick) and Lu√≠s Pais Bernardo (CEsA/CSG/ISEG/ULisboa): About this Seminar Capital Markets by Design? The Rise of Financial Development Planning in Southeast Asia In Southeast Asia, the financial crisis of the late 1990s highlighted the heightened uncertainty brought about by accelerating financial globalization. It spurred efforts to create more resilient financial systems via the consolidation of banking systems and the development of domestic debt capital markets. This talk explores the notion that changes in financial systems have been driven by a shift in the mode of governance from planning to design as has been manifest in the proliferation of financial development planning exercises. Whilst economic development planning is nothing new in Southeast Asia, the production of standalone financial sector development plans is of relatively recent provenance. It reflects a shift from planning for outcomes to planning for uncertainty, placing emphasis on flexible adaptability and resilience. About Lena Rethel (University of Warwick) Research interests include the international politics of finance and development, the global governance of Islamic economies (finance, food, and so on) and the disciplinary parameters and spatial location of contemporary International Political Economy. Substantively, her work to date has concentrated on both the theories and common senses that underpin economic and financial policymaking, the question of how this leads to institutional change (in particular the expansion of capital markets and development of Islamic finance) and the socio-economic implications of these changes. Her research draws significantly from insights from the Southeast Asia region, especially Indonesia and Malaysia. Her research has been supported by the Leverhulme Trust, the British Council Newton Fund and a Princeton Fung Global Fellowship. About Lu√≠s Pais Bernardo (CEsA/CSG/ISEG/ULisboa) Completed the Master in Comparative Politics in 2009 by the Institute of Social Sciences, University of Lisbon, Degree in History in 2007 by the Universidade Nova de Lisboa Faculty of Social and Human Sciences and Doctor (PhD) in Sociology on 2018/01/17 by Humboldt- Universit√§t zu Berlin Institut f√ºr Sozialwissenschaften. He has published 6 articles in specialized journals and owns 2 book(s). He works in the areas of Social Sciences with an emphasis on Political Science. In his professional activities he interacted with 17 collaborators in co-authorship of scientific works. The seminars are an initiative that, since 1991, promotes research carried out in the areas of study of MDCI/ISEG/ULisboa and PDED/ISEG/ULisboa.
