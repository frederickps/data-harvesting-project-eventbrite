2 hours,Contact the organizer to request a refund.,"Join us for a stimulating conversation with your lovely book club host, Andre, and other book lovers. Come for dinner or a natural wine, stay for the conversation and new friendships. Near a village high in the Pyrenees, Domènec wanders across a ridge, fancying himself more a poet than a farmer, to “reel off his verses over on this side of the mountain.” He gathers black chanterelles, attends to a troubled cow. And then storm clouds swell, full of electrifying power. Reckless, gleeful, they release their bolts of lightning, one of which strikes Domènec. He dies. The ghosts of seventeenth-century witches gather around him, taking up the chanterelles he’d harvested before going on their merry ways. So begins this novel that is as much about the mountains and the mushrooms as it is about the human dramas that unfold in their midst. When I Sing, Mountains Dance, winner of the European Union Prize, is a giddy paean to the land in all its interconnectedness, and in it Sola finds a distinct voice for each extraordinary consciousness: the lightning bolts, roe deer, mountains, the ghosts of the civil war, the widow Sió and later her grown children, Hilari and Mia, as well as Mia’s lovers with their long-buried secrets and their hidden pain. Irene Solà animates the polyphonic world around us, the fierce music of the seasons, as well as the stories we tell to comprehend loss and love on a personal, historical, and even geological scale. Lyrical, elemental, and mythic, hers is a fearlessly imaginative new voice that brilliantly renders both our tragedies and our triumphs. This book can be purchased at Fable.

2 hours,Contact the organizer to request a refund.,"Join us for a stimulating conversation with your lovely book club host, Iton, and other book lovers. Come for dinner or a natural wine, stay for the conversation and new friendships. “Welcome to the family,” Nina Winchester says as I shake her elegant, manicured hand. I smile politely, gazing around the marble hallway. Working here is my last chance to start fresh. I can pretend to be whoever I like. But I’ll soon learn that the Winchesters’ secrets are far more dangerous than my own… Every day I clean the Winchesters’ beautiful house top to bottom. I collect their daughter from school. And I cook a delicious meal for the whole family before heading up to eat alone in my tiny room on the top floor. I try to ignore how Nina makes a mess just to watch me clean it up. How she tells strange lies about her own daughter. And how her husband Andrew seems more broken every day. But as I look into Andrew’s handsome brown eyes, so full of pain, it’s hard not to imagine what it would be like to live Nina’s life. The walk-in closet, the fancy car, the perfect husband. I only try on one of Nina’s pristine white dresses once. Just to see what it’s like. But she soon finds out… and by the time I realize my attic bedroom door only locks from the outside, it’s far too late. But I reassure myself: the Winchesters don’t know who I really am. They don’t know what I’m capable of… An unbelievably twisty read that will have you glued to the pages late into the night. Anyone who loves The Woman in the Window, The Wife Between Us and The Girl on the Train won’t be able to put this down! This book can be purchased at Fable.

What you may not know is that our Minds have an identity. Creating an Identity of mind allows us to direct our external world intentionally. The language we use to run our lives is one dimensional, which creates needless limitations. Our minds work best in a multidimensional language. Learning how to access your minds resources correctly will enable you to create a life beyond who we desire to be. Our vocabulary, are words we use internally to motivate change, but instead of encouraging us, the imperfections in our speech and articulation restrict access to our minds. There is no synchronicity between the one-dimensional language in our speech and the 4 th dimension of the mind.

NA,NA,"Did you know Lisbon suffered a tremendous earthquake in 1755, followed by a tsumani and fires all over the city? It was devastating and the reason why this area of the city is so modern and arquitecturally organized. Baixa-Chiado is the sophisticated part of Lisbon, but also where its bohemian and cultural life is more alive. Here, intellectuals, writers and artists made presence to discuss Portuguese society in famous cultural gatherings. Later on, it was also here that the democratic revolution took place, ending a 41 years dictatorship. It was made of war tanks and carnations, and it reflects the Portuguese way of being. We call it a country of brandos costumes, meaning we prefer to solve matters in a quiet way. Not quiet at all is the experience you will have with us! We will guide you through some of our city’s historic milestones, but also to some of its famous delicacies – like the delicious pastry Pastel de nata and the typical beverage Ginginha.
