They won’t. Which is why I challenge you to cut to the chase, give feedback early and directly, before the cracks widen. If you don’t – don’t under-estimate the personal, organisational and opportunity cost of the conversation you’re avoiding.

This means we can frame our unique curriculum around your personal goals and desired outcomes. And you’ll be learning from Pros who practice what they teach in the real world. Focused and fun. We’ve taken our much-loved improv workshops for teams and expanded the curriculum to give individuals an opportunity to grow, learn, play, and reap all the benefits of improv. This improv class will give you invaluable skills that you’ll use for the rest of your career and life. And you’ll have so much fun, you’ll probably want to take it more than once. HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE SIGNING UP FOR: 🤝 An Intro to Improv – It’s not about being funny! It’s about learning to React, Adapt, and Communicate. Discover the difference between Editing and Auditing. And embrace what it means to fail joyfully. 👂 Becoming an “Active Listener” – We’re all taught how to read, write, and speak, but nobody ever taught us how to listen, until now. You will transform into an expert and confident conversationalist. 💡 Dynamic Communication & Collaboration – Unlock the Power of “Yes, and.” Use Convergent and Divergent Thinking to innovate like a boss.

Take a class at an improv theatre and they’ll expect you to put on a show. And while conquering stage fright can be freeing and fun, most people just want to perform better at work and in life. We will challenge you, but we’ll never force you to be funny on demand. And we’ll always make sure you feel supported and successful as you acquire new tools to help you perform where it counts.

Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself.

Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7.

NA,Sold out,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

Your business competitors are not only working on stealing your customers away from you, they are also working on stealing your best employees from you. You are competing against other employers to attract and keep high quality employees. And your best employees? In this knowledge based economy, best employees know the key to their own long term well-being is their own skill set. They are hungry for knowledge, for wisdom, they want what's in your head, and they want you to make their learning experience inspirational not painful. If you refuse to teach them, if you are not effective at coaching, or if it's unpleasant to learn under you (you are a typical tyrant of a boss from 1950 LOL) they will quit and go somewhere else for the learning experience.

NA,Sold out,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

Welcome to technofeudalism. Drawing on stories from Greek Myth and pop culture, from Homer toMad Men, Varoufakis explains this revolutionary transformation: how it enslaves our minds, how it rewrites the rules of global power and ultimately what it will take overthrow it.About Yanis VaroufakisYanis Varoufakis is an economist, political leader and the author of numerous bestselling books:Talking to My Daughter: A Brief History of Capitalism;Adults in the Room, a memoir of his time as finance minister of Greece; an economic history of Europe,And The Weak Suffer What They Must?; andAnother Now: Dispatches from An Alternative Present.

NA,Sold out,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class! Or come back to the class if you get interrupted! 1: Delegation Skills for Busy Leaders - Why & How 2: How To Motivate & Inspire Your Employees?

They are hungry for knowledge, for wisdom, they want what's in your head, and they want you to make their learning experience inspirational not painful.

NA,Sold out,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

He is the Editor-in-chief of Building Simulation and Section Editor of Energy and Buildings. He is also the Chair of China HVAC Society’s Building Simulation Committee, Chair of IBPSA-China and co-chair of ASHRAE Occupant Behaviour in Building Technical Committee TC 7.10. Professor Yan’s research mainly focuses on the development of building performance simulation software DeST, research on quantitative description of occupant behaviour and low-carbon and energy-efficiency related policy. He has published over 240 journal articles and more than 10 books, with an H-index is 53 (by google). During 2013 to 2018, he is the OA of IEA EBC Annex 66 with more than 100 participants from more than 20 countries, working on “Definition and simulation of occupant behavior in buildings”. He was the receipt of the Second Prize of National Science Progress Award of China in 2008. He is an IBPSA Fellow since 2019. Abstract: Occupant behaviour (OB) is one of the key contributing factors to building energy consumption. Occupant behaviour features complexity, diversity, and stochasticity. Over-simplified methods to quantify the impacts of occupant behaviour in building performance simulations significantly impacts the differences between simulation and measurement. Therefore, it is essential to propose a systematic approach to understand and simulate occupant behaviour in buildings. In this presentation, an overall technical framework of OB modelling in buildings is demonstrated, including data collection, model development and evaluation. The research progress of advanced sensors, big data, and algorithms are introduced. With the OB modelling shifting from building to urban, this presentation will also explore the stochasticity and heterogeneity of OB simulation at an urban scale. To further implement OB models in practical applications, a case study of level-of-detail (LoD) framework is proposed to identify the appropriate granularity to describe OB to fit in various practices. Finally, challenges and future development in OB modelling will be discussed.",0,0,AUD,"Arts, Design & Architecture events",https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-12T03:00:00Z,2024-03-12T04:00:00Z,Occupant Behaviour Modelling in Buildings: Status and Challenges,"Public lecture by Professor Da Yan, Tsinghua University",https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/occupant-behaviour-modelling-in-buildings-status-and-challenges-tickets-851998148397,sydney

Hybrid eventThis is a hybrid event, you can attend in person by registering on this page, or online via Teams here. This presentation is based on my forthcoming book, Liberalism as a Way of Life, and about how liberal values and practices can be the basis for a personal worldview, way of living, and spiritual orientation. You don’t have to be liberal and something else, such as Christian, Buddhist, Kantian, hedonist, utilitarian, or whatever else. It is fully possible and rewarding to be liberal through and through. This means that the values and attitudes enshrined in liberal political institutions, and ubiquitous in the background culture of liberal democracies – such as reciprocity, tolerance, personal freedom, impartiality, equality of opportunity, irony, and the like – have the potential to inform a much more general sensibility, one that is supple enough to be realized in all different aspects of life: from family to the workplace, from friendship to enmity, from humour to outrage, and everything in between. Alexandre Lefebvre is Professor of Politics and Philosophy at The University of Sydney. He is the author of Liberalism as a Way of Life (Princeton 2024), Human Rights and the Care of the Self (Duke 2018), Human Rights as a Way of Life: on Bergson's Political Philosophy (Stanford 2013), and The Image of Law: Deleuze, Bergson, Spinoza (Stanford 2008).

I also create with mixed media and use the beauty of shapes, flowers, and animals as multiple transparent layers in a composition, blended to generate deeper meanings.  I m a strong believer in using what you have and what you have learnt, and putting it into practice. I like to use my imagination to create beautiful things. My artworks are all related to everything in life that fascinates me and always overwhelmed me with excitement. I need their stories to be told through my art. Some of my subjects are darker but I like to share the different sides of them. Especially the beauty of the lessons in life, sacrifices, inner strengths and beliefs, all these topics are very important for me to share.

NA,Sold out,NA,"The Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide will conduct its final public hearing at the InterContinental Sydney, 117 Macquarie Street, from Monday 4 March to Thursday 28 March 2024. Anyone wishing to attend the public hearing can pre-register via Eventbrite. Please note that the witness list for Hearing Block 12 has already been finalised and registering to attend the hearing means you wish to attend as a member of the audience. The Royal Commission has identified all witnesses to be called at this Hearing Block.  Senior Government Ministers, military chiefs and Departmental heads will be called to give evidence at the Royal Commission’s final public hearing. Full witness lists will be released closer to the event. The Royal Commission’s inquiries have been guided by the deeply personal and often harrowing experiences shared by serving and ex-serving ADF members, and their families, in submissions and private sessions, which have shone a bright light on the cultural, systemic and structural issues contributing to the suicide crisis within the Defence and veteran community.  Public hearings are a critical evidence gathering tool and the Royal Commission must use the limited time available to call witnesses whose stories and information speak directly to key issues and themes where there might be evidence or knowledge gaps it’s seeking to address.   This is particularly so with our final public hearing, which will be of significance to our final report and recommendations.   The Royal Commission acknowledges there will be some in the community who are disappointed not to be called as a lived experience witness at its upcoming hearing; however, Commissioners and staff want to sincerely thank everyone who has shared their experience with us for the significant contribution they have made to this inquiry.  We are incredibly grateful for your courage and strength in coming forward and hope that by knowing the important role you’ve played in this inquiry that you feel heard. The Royal Commission expects some days to reach seating capacity. As such, members of the public are encouraged to register in advance for each day they wish to attend the hearing.  The hearing schedule may change without notice. Daily start and finish times are approximate and will be confirmed closer to the event. Please visit the Royal Commission's website for regular updates. For those unable to attend in person, the proceedings will be livestreamed on the Royal Commission's website. Please be aware that these hearings might contain material and images that are distressing for some people. The nature of the hearings also means that there might be people in military uniforms, as well as military service providers, present. For further updates from the Royal Commission, you can subscribe to our monthly newsletter or follow us on Facebook and Twitter. Prior to entering the hearing room you will be required to submit to security screening, including bag checks.

NA,Sold out,NA,"Overcome public speaking fear with gradual exposure, in a supportive environment. Observe a free trial to see if it's right for you. Based out of New York City for 30 years, we are now offering these classes online to an international audience.  This one free trial class is an observation session to see if the US$425/10 session program is right for you. The instructor will be happy to answer any questions following the session. ****30 Years of Testimonials: https://www.speakeeezi.com/success.htm Zenspeak Public Speaking Center: https://www.speakeeezi.com Once the 10 session package is purchased, the student may use their sessions however they choose.  The course is ongoing, so each session has participants at all levels. We use a workbook which each student works through at their own pace. This is the 30th year we’ve been helping people turn their dread into confidence. Gradual exposure allows you to face fear in manageable steps, at your own pace, in a supportive environment. Instructors Charles di Cagno and Kyra Smith, are phobia therapists, and former and current Directors of Public Speaking at White Plains Hospital Anxiety Treatment Center in the United States.  Whatever the level of public speaking, we can help you improve. For those with anxiety, we provide gradual exposure to public speaking through a step ladder of basic to more advanced exercises. For the more experienced, it's a platform tailored to your specific needs to improve various delivery techniques. It is self-paced, in a low pressure, supportive environment with lots of feedback to address your specific issues. Begin with basic exercises and move forward only when ready.  The course is ongoing, with a mix of beginning and advanced students. Our hope is you are inspired, not intimidated by the dynamic speakers present, and keep in mind they started with the same fears, progressing to their present level by consistent effort. The course is not difficult. If you have the will, we offer the way to turn a liability into your most powerful asset. The real challenge is admitting you need guidance, getting started, and making a committed, consistent effort. Our 100% success rate over 20 years for wedding speeches is just one indication of our effectiveness. But, whatever the challenge, (formal presentation, group discussion, business meeting, sales, confrontation, employment interview) the program is customized to fit your needs. Sample Gradual Exposure Program Outline for Public Speaking Anxiety: Session One - Get comfortable hearing your voice in public by responding to very simple questions while seated. The questions (i.e., name, occupation, where you live, etc.) require little thought or content. Session Two - Learning to stand confidently before a group. You will stand, with several others and respond to simple questions. As your confidence increases, one by one, each person standing will sit, until you are standing alone. You will continue until this begins to feel comfortable. Session Three- This exercise is the same as the previous one except you start by standing alone. Session Four - Gestures and Movement. Enhance your message, decrease tension and project a confident demeanor incorporating non-verbal skills. Session Five - Implement the skills learned in the session four by relating a personal experience using gestures and movement to enhance your narrative. Session Six - Respond to Questions. Open the floor to questions on a topic of choice. Session Seven - Impromptu Speaking. Learn to organize and deliver an unprepared (no notes) talk. Session Eight - Prepared Speech (Instructor Guided). Learn the secret of outlining and presenting a prepared speech with minimal effort or stress. Session Nine - Prepared Speech. Outline and deliver a speech unassisted. Once you have mastered the above you can begin simulating all manner of interpersonal and public communication including: Persuasive Speaking Panel Discussion Conflict Resolution Defending your Position Debating Initiating and Sustaining Conversation As well as many others We look forward to working with you.",0,0,USD,k smith,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-11T22:00:00Z,2024-03-11T23:30:00Z,Conquer Your Fear of Public Speaking - Sydney- Virtual Free Trial Class,"Overcome public speaking fear with gradual exposure, in a supportive environment.

NA,Sold out,Contact the organiser to request a refund.,"Welcome to Forest Hill Arabian Stud. We have been breeding Arabian horses for over 50 years. We are a mother & son, small local business. We also offer accomodation under the name Yarramalong Valley Horse Farmstay.  On the farm tour we will take you around the farm to see and interact with all of our loveable animals: 45 majestic purebred Arabian Horses, our family of lop eared rabbits, cheeky silkie chickens, adventurous miniature goats, gorgeous miniature ponies and gentle sheep.  You'll also take a ride around the 55 acre farm in our mini jeep and a short walk through our private forest with picturesque views, river frontage and fern gullies home to a variety of wildlife. The kids will get to see where the wombats & foxes sleep & if lucky spot a platypus in the river. As you walk around the farm you will take in beautiful scenery and a wide array of native birds which take up residence in our beautiful trees around the farm. Think kookaburras, galahs, cockatoos, rosellas, friendly magpies & much more.  Lots of photo opportunities! Our 2 hour farm animal experience tours are available with a maximum of 10 people per tour. Participants will be moving around on the farm, so come prepared with hats, sunscreen, bug spray (if needed), closed in shoes and enough drinking water & snacks for the little ones. We also recommend you bring a few bags of carrots if you would like to walk around the farm and feed some horses after the tour. Also if you have any fresh food scraps or peels from the few days before your tour date we would love for you to bring them. I’m sure the animals will appreciate it!  If you are looking to escape from city life or get back to nature for a few hours and escape those work stresses, come visit us and experience the tranquility of country living.  We are located in Wyong Creek on the Central Coast, NSW. We are only an hours drive from Sydney and are only 5 minutes off the M1 and 5 minutes from the nearest train stations (Wyong or Tuggerah). We are also 5 minutes from Tuggerah Westfield & 25 minutes from beautiful beaches.  If you would like to stay overnight or have your next farmstay holiday here, we have multiple accommodation options available on Airbnb under the name “Yarramalong Valley Horse Farm Stay”. You can also find our accomodation at our website:  www.yarramalongvalleyhorsefarmstay.com   Apartment: https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/21208556?source_impression_id=p3_1605086448_wOMy8ZnLwBKgliJ%2F.

( Just copy & paste the above url into a webpage & the Airbnb will load. Not sure why the link would not work when I copied it on to this page ). We also host weddings, events & parties for all ages (not just kids!).  We can also modify the farm tour to cater for those with disabilities and special needs.   We do not have a minimum number for booking but we do appreciate that if there are only a few of you that you do your best to invite another family or some friends to also join you on the tour to help fill the booking. If that is not possible of course it is still fine to book. If possible though it helps us tremendously as we put a lot of time into all the kids to ensure they all have a wonderful experience & it is very expensive running a farm with all these animals. I also find the kids often have even more fun when they also get to bring their friends along & experience the animals together.  DIRECTIONS for TOUR: Just come in 267 Yarramalong Road driveway & go down the hill towards the barn. You will notice a concrete turning circle with a tree in the middle & a white bath tub next to it. Just park to the left of that & we will meet at the turning circle at the time for your tour. Any questions just message me. Thanks!
