In this presentation you will be taken on an exciting journey from a time before white settlement, to the rough ‘grab what you can’ of the early settlers on the nor’west coast of West Australia to the boom times before World War 1. Over 400 pearling lugger boats operated out of Broome at that time. The Pearling Masters wielded enormous political leverage in a unique industry that eventually collapsed at the end of World War 2 with the introduction of plastic buttons. The rebuilding of our cultured pearl industry led to Australia producing some of the finest pearls in the world. Pearls have been prized throughout history and you will hear about the mystique and glamour of some famous pearls and the people who wore them.

They use a strategy of making friends with customers and while this works sometimes, there are certainly buyers out there who just don’t like this approach at all.

NA,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

Your business competitors are not only working on stealing your customers away from you, they are also working on stealing your best employees from you.

They are hungry for knowledge, for wisdom, they want what's in your head, and they want you to make their learning experience inspirational not painful.

NA,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

These sessions activate this energy, increasing our experience and awareness of it. During a session you may experience this energy moving through various aspects of your being - physical body, emotions, mind, spirit, consciousness - bringing emotional or physical release, clarity or insight, discovery, aliveness, openness and connection, or deep relaxation and inner stillness. The very act of surrendering to this life-force, of trust and simply letting go, and allowing it to flow through us, to hold, guide and dance with us can be profound. Every activation and each person's journey with kundalini is unique. I am also available for Private Individual or Group Sessions Live or Online. Please contact me if you are interested. Also, if you have any questions please feel free to reach out. ******* What happens during a Session? • After introductions, you simply lie down on a yoga mat and close your eyes. Some music is played, and I work live or remotely with your energy field. You will be lying down for approximately 1 hour. Following the music part of the session, participants can choose to share their experiences. Then we close our sharing circle. Possible responses • Spontaneous movements or shaking in the body. Deep insights or realizations. Visions and heightened senses. Expressions of emotions and release of blockages. Or shifts in your awareness and being in the coming days after a session. These are just some of the things that participants can and do experience. ******* So this can be accessible to all ~ TICKET COST: On a sliding scale 🌠 Pay what feels good! ✨ We look forward to meeting you all! 💗🌸 Rebecca and Richard ******* ***I highly recommend Rebecca's Inner Dance and Kundalini Activation sessions to anyone who is currently on their spiritual awakening journey and would like to shed deep layers of belief systems, emotions, and trauma that are no longer serving them. Her sessions take you on a beautiful sound meditative journey where Rebecca facilitates some really powerful energetic shifts within you. The sessions have been life changing for me! Sarah D. ~ Yoga Teacher - Central Coast, NSW Australia ***The Umina Immersion Weekend was so special. I felt so much, and the more I learn about InnerDance, the greater my appreciation is for everything you and Richard are bringing to and creating in those sessions for people. The electricity and the magnetism, the feminine and the masculine, in a safe and inclusive space. It's beyond beautiful. Kate K. ~ NSW Australia ***Kundalini had such an amazing impact in my life. I’ve been on this awakening journey for many years but I can ’t tell you how much that weekend of immersion accelerated the process. I’m forever grateful.` Eneida K `~ Sunshine Coast QLD Australia ***My Kundalini Activation experiences with Rebecca have felt so loving, supportive and safe. I experienced something different every time and always felt more awakened on a physical, energetic, emotional, spiritual level. I experienced free flowing body movements which I can now tap into when I dance for myself or meditate on the Divine Feminine. I had visions that blew my mind. I expressed and released emotions that I didn't realise I was holding on to. So much went on in each session and I was able to completely surrender because I felt safe with Bec. Popi I. - Psychologist, Oriental Dance and Yoga teacher. Budding artist. ~ Sydney ***Rebecca held incredibly professional space for something that was so deeply spiritual . I had a Kundalini awakening in my early 20s, and can confirm 100% that this is the energy she is working with. A surge of electrical/vibrational energy pulsed through my body and the energy was healing, connective, and brought me deep in to my senses. She is the real deal, and I would highly recommend.

They are hungry for knowledge, for wisdom, they want what's in your head, and they want you to make their learning experience inspirational not painful. If you refuse to teach them, if you are not effective at coaching, or if it's unpleasant to learn under you (you are a typical tyrant of a boss from 1950 LOL) they will quit and go somewhere else for the learning experience.

Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7.

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

Doors open at 7:00pm with the show kicking off at 7:30pm at the Potts Point Hotel, a short walk from Kings Cross station. A night of killer comedians, improv, banter with drinks available all night. Earlybird - $19.99 tickets available, including booking fee if you book up to 1 week in advance (limited quantity available each week) Group Discount - Buy 4 tickets for the price of 3 (limited quantity available each week) The first half features a line-up of some of the country’s best stand-up comedians from internet stars to media personalities with an array of styles. We’ve previously had well known comics like Luke Kidgell, Concetta Caristo and Dave Hughes drop in so you never know who you might catch. The second half is when things really kick off. Beginning with the comedians testing their wits with line games and prompts that have gained millions of views across social media and continuing with a series of games, improv and sets that promise to push the boundaries and keep you entertained. Each week sees a different line-up of comedians and with the second half being largely improvised, every show is always different. Lineups are posted on the Comedy Untamed Instagram 1-2 days before the show but we always have surprise guests. We allow comedians to explore whatever topic they so choose. This means there is a high likelihood of controversial or sexual themes. Under 18s may attend with a guardian, although it is best to check with the venue as this may be subject to change. Comedy Untamed regularly sells out so it’s best to get your tickets nice and early. There may be tickets available at the door but often the show sells out so it's best to buy online. If there are a lot of comedians the show may run with stand up sets in both halves and on rare occaisons we may not do the line games. The show will generally end between 9:15 and 9:45pm. Potts Point Hotel is wheelchair accessible please inform the bar if the lift is required.

The application of these techniques will be presented as part of an overall framework, as you identify key deliverables and the major steps from modeling and analysis of the current state and future state design. Course Outline: Develop the Process List Every workplace contains business processes, however not all business processes are documented. This section focuses on how to develop a process list. After identifying the business processes, decision-making tools are practiced to consider what is important to the business. These tools include using prioritization and weighting criteria to make decisions based on business needs. Finally, you will discover how to gain support and buy-in from key stakeholders. Define the Scope Identifying the scope of the business process is critical for defining the boundaries of the project. In this section you will learn how to identify and document the boundaries of the business process that needs to be improved. Discussion and consideration of overcoming scope creep problems is also reviewed regarding the business process. Finally, you will determine what approvals are necessary before moving into a detailed business analysis. Draw the Process Model Process modeling ensures an understanding of the business processes being analyzed. In this section, you will learn the basics of process models, standard charting shapes, and the various levels used to draw business processes. Both visual models and text are practiced in this section to ensure an understanding of the current state, as well as review who needs to be involved in this step. Estimate Time and Cost Estimating time and cost for the current state involves analyzing process and cycle time, as well as existing costs to provide a return on investment. Examination of how to determine time and cost estimates for the current state is provided in this section, as well as the specific types of costs to analyze for potential business process improvement. Validate the Process Model Reviewing and confirming your analysis of the current state is critical before identifying potential improvements for the desired future state. This section focuses on the correct sequence to perform the validation steps with the project stakeholders. After validation is completed, improvement targets can begin to be identified. Apply Improvement Methods Now that the current state has been validated, the course focus begins to shift toward the future state. This section includes applying multiple techniques for proposing changes to the future state by using an extreme visual model. A process is followed to apply six improvement methods to ensure effective analysis work has been applied. Upon completion of analyzing what to improve, you will draw the process model for the proposed future state. Establish Controls & Metrics Adding controls to the business process ensures accuracy, reliability and can reduce errors. In this first part of the section, you will identify controls necessary for the future state. Establishing metrics helps ensure effectiveness, efficiency and adaptability of the business process. The second part of this section will help you distinguish which metrics will help evaluate whether the improved business process will work as you planned. Test the Process Testing the new or improved business process helps to identify bottlenecks, as well as work out bugs, defects and/or errors. Testing also helps ensure the process meets stated goals and provides for smooth implementation of the business process. This section will help you identify what needs to be included in testing the proposed future state. Evaluate Change Readiness During the analysis process it is critical to consider what the business is trying to accomplish. Evaluating change readiness helps to create strategies for minimizing the change impacts on the workplace, the workers, as well as avoiding distractions. This section examines change impacts, resistors to change and how to create an implementation plan for the changes identified to the business process. Perform Continuous Improvement Continuous improvement is an ongoing effort to enhance products, services or processes. This section focuses on how to monitor a business process and make adjustments as necessary so the business process repeatedly gets better over time. You will learn how to use different root cause analysis techniques to improve business processes and how to put together a continuous improvement plan. Finally, you will monitor data to identify and rank performance problems once the business process has been piloted.

Your business competitors are not only working on stealing your customers away from you, they are also working on stealing your best employees from you. You are competing against other employers to attract and keep high quality employees. And your best employees? In this knowledge based economy, best employees know the key to their own long term well-being is their own skill set. They are hungry for knowledge, for wisdom, they want what's in your head, and they want you to make their learning experience inspirational not painful. If you refuse to teach them, if you are not effective at coaching, or if it's unpleasant to learn under you (you are a typical tyrant of a boss from 1950 LOL) they will quit and go somewhere else for the learning experience.

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

NA,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

NA,Contact the organiser to request a refund.,"Most business stories are self-congratulating puff. They are the human equivalent of a stranger you meet at a party who talks endlessly about themselves. Before long, you are looking over their shoulder for someone more interesting. And that could be your competitor. Our Global CEO and Chief Storyteller Chris Hewitt will be facilitating the workshop in this three-hour session. We aim to bring clarity to your communications for internal and external stakeholders. And this will, in turn, win hearts, minds, and more revenues for your business. How do bestselling authors cajole readers to keep turning the page? What glues us to the seat at the cinema or theatre? Why do some influencers command such a huge following? Professional storytellers such as filmmakers, writers, authors and journalists follow a bunch of rules that are largely the same. There’s a magic formula to telling stories. We have codified their secrets into a process that works for businesses like yours. Through storytelling, sales pitches become more successful. Social media posts more shareable. Content more colourful. You will be able to power-up your presentations so that they become more memorable. In fact, the intimacy created by storytelling, will improve your relationships, and even create lasting friendships with your clients. Why? Because we all love a good storyteller. We all like listening to someone who can entertain us. Hold our attention. Not because of what they say or do, but because of how they make us feel. Chris is the founder, chief storyteller and CEO of the Berkeley Communications Group that comprises PR and communications hub agencies in the UK, Germany, US and Australia, plus a global network that extends to Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Latin America.

NA,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

We are not just about referrals but also supporting you and your business inside a great community. Our meetings are focused on three key elements: INSPIRE - Our aim is that each week you will be encouraged & inspired in business, either by listening to another businesses journey or connecting with great people who could potentially become a great referral source for your business, or maybe even getting that lead via meeting the right person to take your business to the next level. We want every member to feel valued & know that each time we meet we are walking away with at least 1 thing that inspires us to go back to our business feeling enabled to make those changes, maybe try something new. EDUCATE - Albert Einstein is reported to have said: “The day we stop learning is the day we die”. Sounds so dramatic but continual learning is imperative to growing yourself & your business. Connecting with other business owners gives you the opportunity to learn from each other, as well as the opportunity to sow into others by sharing your experiences, challenges & wins. Nothing feels better than when you get the chance to share either a horror story or a massive win about your business & tell them how you navigated it. There are so many benefits of learning from each other in a positive professional environment, better together than doing business all alone. ENCOURAGE - Let’s face it... It can be lonely in business at times so it’s good to be in an environment where like-minded business owners rally around and support each other. You’re not meant to do this on your own, that’s one of the reasons HBN exists. It’s amazing how you feel when you are surrounded by people who believe in you & cheer you on each week. This is the environment we are creating, where, whether you are facing a challenge or celebrating a win, you get to share those experiences with people on the same page as you, some of which have been where you are and who can either give you tips on how they overcame the same challenge or get excited with you about your wins in business.

NA,Contact the organiser to request a refund.,"That's what BBG's all about. You'll find that we're more relaxed than most networking groups. We hold our regular meetings fortnightly, rather than weekly - which can feel a whole lot more manageable if you're a busy business owner. And then, every alternate Thursday, those of us who can, meet for a quick catch up over coffee at a local cafe. In case you're wondering, our fortnightly format still allows for plenty of business referrals to get shared between our members. You can check out the testimonials as to how much on our website. In fact, one recent visitor, left our meeting having gained 8 new customers - some of which will be ongoing. So if you're tired of the same old networking meetings, with the same old rules and regulations of 'turn up, bring visitors, bring referrals - OR ELSE' - join us for breakfast. Experience a different kind of networking. It's fun and it works. With some great cafe's close by you can join our members and pick up a coffee and some breakfast to enjoy during the meeting.  What else do you need to know? Please arrive by 6.45am sharp.  Also did we mention  your ticket entitles you to a complimentary tea or coffee  from the Dougherty Centre cafe.  Feel free to bring breakfast along otherwise breakfast options are avaliable at the cafe. If you require any assistance with your booking or on the day of the meeting, please contact our Vice President - Jennie Tonner 0413 654 298 or our  Visitor Host - Nicole Cannon 0414 633 793. There is no overlap of professional services in our group, so there's no competition. Once you're a member, you 'own' your professional spot. So what you'll find is a mix of compatible professions that share clients without any worries of losing clients. Being part of the BBG membership often means you can offer your clients a much larger variety of services and solutions than you could ever offer on your own. That really is clever business.  For us, it's all about getting to know each other as people, having a laugh and over time building up enough trust to do (or refer) business to our members. After all, you don't want to do business with people you don't like. So that's where we start - building relationships over time. Networking isn't a 'quick fix', or a 'numbers game', it never has been. Once those relationships are formed, referrals build not only within the room, but to the people our members know outside the room and then several generations deep. ",20,20,AUD,Building Business Group,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-13T19:45:00Z,2024-03-13T21:30:00Z,Building Business Group (BBG) Breakfast,Networking group that feels more like you're in a room full of friends than a 'networking breakfast',https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/building-business-group-bbg-breakfast-tickets-55315650600,sydney,Sold out

Your business competitors are not only working on stealing your customers away from you, they are also working on stealing your best employees from you. You are competing against other employers to attract and keep high quality employees. And your best employees?

They are hungry for knowledge, for wisdom, they want what's in your head, and they want you to make their learning experience inspirational not painful.

NA,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

About the exhibition Step into a world where time-honoured Chinese traditions and cherished iconic motifs come alive, painting a vivid tapestry of nostalgia and cultural resonance. Our upcoming art exhibition is a heartfelt tribute to the rich heritage of China, celebrating the captivating allure of its traditional painting and the familiar elements found within its homes. ""Journey Through Tradition: A Celebration of Chinese Icons"" invites you to rekindle the flame of childhood memories, evoking the warmth of lantern-lit evenings in village squares. Immerse yourself in the tender symbolism of the Mandarin duck, an emblem of love that has transcended generations. Stand in awe of the elegant cranes, guardians of longevity, immortality, and wisdom, as they dance across canvases, bestowing their profound significance upon our present. As you traverse the exhibition, you'll encounter a resplendent display of vases and urns that have gracefully adorned traditional Chinese restaurants and homes. Each delicate brushstroke captures the essence of time-honoured craftsmanship, a living testament to the enduring allure of Chinese design. Marking a remarkable alignment with the cosmic rhythms, our exhibition takes centre stage during the Lunar New Year, an auspicious moment when the Year of the Dragon graces us with its presence. This legendary and enigmatic creature, an emblem of strength and transformation, takes on a prominent role in our showcase, its magnificence accentuating the synergy between past and present. ""Journey Through Tradition"" beckons you to embark on a voyage through the heart of China's artistic legacy, a sensory exploration of iconic symbols that resonate across cultures and generations.

About  Anthony Van Lam As a watercolourist, I strive to create beautiful organic shapes representing healing and wellness through an exploration of lines, silhouettes, and colour. I also create with mixed media and use the beauty of shapes, flowers, and animals as multiple transparent layers in a composition, blended to generate deeper meanings.  I m a strong believer in using what you have and what you have learnt, and putting it into practice. I like to use my imagination to create beautiful things. My artworks are all related to everything in life that fascinates me and always overwhelmed me with excitement. I need their stories to be told through my art. Some of my subjects are darker but I like to share the different sides of them.

Anyone wishing to attend the public hearing can pre-register via Eventbrite. Please note that the witness list for Hearing Block 12 has already been finalised and registering to attend the hearing means you wish to attend as a member of the audience. The Royal Commission has identified all witnesses to be called at this Hearing Block.  Senior Government Ministers, military chiefs and Departmental heads will be called to give evidence at the Royal Commission’s final public hearing. Full witness lists will be released closer to the event. The Royal Commission’s inquiries have been guided by the deeply personal and often harrowing experiences shared by serving and ex-serving ADF members, and their families, in submissions and private sessions, which have shone a bright light on the cultural, systemic and structural issues contributing to the suicide crisis within the Defence and veteran community.  Public hearings are a critical evidence gathering tool and the Royal Commission must use the limited time available to call witnesses whose stories and information speak directly to key issues and themes where there might be evidence or knowledge gaps it’s seeking to address.   This is particularly so with our final public hearing, which will be of significance to our final report and recommendations.   The Royal Commission acknowledges there will be some in the community who are disappointed not to be called as a lived experience witness at its upcoming hearing; however, Commissioners and staff want to sincerely thank everyone who has shared their experience with us for the significant contribution they have made to this inquiry.  We are incredibly grateful for your courage and strength in coming forward and hope that by knowing the important role you’ve played in this inquiry that you feel heard. The Royal Commission expects some days to reach seating capacity. As such, members of the public are encouraged to register in advance for each day they wish to attend the hearing.  The hearing schedule may change without notice. Daily start and finish times are approximate and will be confirmed closer to the event. Please visit the Royal Commission's website for regular updates. For those unable to attend in person, the proceedings will be livestreamed on the Royal Commission's website. Please be aware that these hearings might contain material and images that are distressing for some people. The nature of the hearings also means that there might be people in military uniforms, as well as military service providers, present. For further updates from the Royal Commission, you can subscribe to our monthly newsletter or follow us on Facebook and Twitter. Prior to entering the hearing room you will be required to submit to security screening, including bag checks.

2 hours,NA,"There’s a lot of information out there about planning well and getting our affairs in order. It can be hard to know where to begin! This 2 hour, in-person workshop will help you pull it all together and explore end-of-life planning in an engaging, accessible way. It will leave you feeling confident in knowing what options are right for you and your family, whilst recognising the strength of your existing skills and experience. Only 53% of Australians feel able to talk to another family member about end of life. The Ten Things to Know Before You Go workshop gives you the tools for these essential planning conversations to flow easily and productively. From accessing the legal documents to planning a funeral and understanding palliative care, this workshop covers all the essentials and helps you navigate ‘what’s next’, in a relaxed, supportive learning environment with other people who are looking to plan well. Previous participants have left feeling more empowered with knowledge about navigating different aspects of the end of life system. 80% of participants have reported that they took direct action in end of life planning as a result of the workshop. Kicked the bucket. Croaking it. Pushing-up daisies. Passed over, on, away. The D-word. We have no shortage of names for it, but when faced with death we are often lost for words. The Groundswell Project Australia works with individuals, organisations and communities to improve how people in Australia die, care and grieve. They run educational workshops, develop innovative programs and advocate for a better end of life experience for all. Our superstitions, fears about dying and the discomfort we feel, affect our approach and experiences of the end of life. Death is often over medicalised and institutionalised in Australia, and the health care system does not harness the real value of involving family and friends in the process. Because of the lack of options, knowledge, capacity and decision making power, there are often negative repercussions for the person dying and those around them.  We reckon it's time for an upgrade on how we go about our dying matters.  Read more about the amazing work The Groundswell Project Australia are championing at their website www.thegroundswellproject.com.

We also offer accomodation under the name Yarramalong Valley Horse Farmstay.  On the farm tour we will take you around the farm to see and interact with all of our loveable animals: 45 majestic purebred Arabian Horses, our family of lop eared rabbits, cheeky silkie chickens, adventurous miniature goats, gorgeous miniature ponies and gentle sheep.  You'll also take a ride around the 55 acre farm in our mini jeep and a short walk through our private forest with picturesque views, river frontage and fern gullies home to a variety of wildlife. The kids will get to see where the wombats & foxes sleep & if lucky spot a platypus in the river. As you walk around the farm you will take in beautiful scenery and a wide array of native birds which take up residence in our beautiful trees around the farm. Think kookaburras, galahs, cockatoos, rosellas, friendly magpies & much more.  Lots of photo opportunities! Our 2 hour farm animal experience tours are available with a maximum of 10 people per tour. Participants will be moving around on the farm, so come prepared with hats, sunscreen, bug spray (if needed), closed in shoes and enough drinking water & snacks for the little ones. We also recommend you bring a few bags of carrots if you would like to walk around the farm and feed some horses after the tour. Also if you have any fresh food scraps or peels from the few days before your tour date we would love for you to bring them. I’m sure the animals will appreciate it!  If you are looking to escape from city life or get back to nature for a few hours and escape those work stresses, come visit us and experience the tranquility of country living.  We are located in Wyong Creek on the Central Coast, NSW. We are only an hours drive from Sydney and are only 5 minutes off the M1 and 5 minutes from the nearest train stations (Wyong or Tuggerah). We are also 5 minutes from Tuggerah Westfield & 25 minutes from beautiful beaches.

We do not have a minimum number for booking but we do appreciate that if there are only a few of you that you do your best to invite another family or some friends to also join you on the tour to help fill the booking. If that is not possible of course it is still fine to book. If possible though it helps us tremendously as we put a lot of time into all the kids to ensure they all have a wonderful experience & it is very expensive running a farm with all these animals. I also find the kids often have even more fun when they also get to bring their friends along & experience the animals together.

5 hours,NA,"Need to make progress on that thesis chapter, journal article or lit review? Want to block out distractions, carve out some time and get some serious writing done? Come along to this all-day writing boot camp, hosted by Graduate Research. It's based on the Pomodoro Technique: throughout the day, we'll be running eight 'pomodoros' – 25-minute bursts of focused writing time, with 5-minute breaks in between – during which you can hunker down, tune out the world and really focus on your work. This is not a writing workshop! You won't be sharing your writing with others in the group, nor learning how to write well. Instead, you'll be working on your own writing alongside others who are working on theirs. (Don't forget your laptop!) Working in a group like this really helps keep you on task, and stops a thousand tiny distractions from gnawing away at your productivity. During the 5-minute breaks, however, you're free to socialise! Have a laugh, share tips, and see how much you've been able to get done. We'll have a variety of snacks, tea and coffee available to keep you energised. And if time is a factor, you don't have to stay for every pomodoro. Make use of this session as you need.
