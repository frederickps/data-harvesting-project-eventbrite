It helps the Front of House Team who are involved in handling new and even existing enquiries to turn more of those enquiries into appointments and ultimately long-term patients.  From First Call to Long Term Patient — One Day Reception Programme Dental Practices spend thousands of dollars each year marketing and attracting leads to the practice. Each lead needs to be treated correctly to ensure that the patient enquiry turns into an appointment, and ultimately a client. This becomes even more important as patients are shopping around for their treatment. If a patient stays as a patient with you for 10 years and they join a membership plan, then they could be potentially worth more than $10,000 to you. That is why the 'Front of House Team' are the most important people within the Dental Practice and often the least trained. This programme is a mixture of presentation, facilitation, discussion and hands on coaching to develop the skills, so that you stand out from the other dental practices and ensure that you turn your enquiries into appointments. We will coach members of your dental practice management on how to take an enquiry from that very first call and turn it into an appointment, so that ultimately they can become a long term patient.

It is a very powerful healing energy and a source of our internal power.  It is located at the base of the spine, and in most of us, it’s inactive.  During this powerful and deeply transformational process, Gabriela will work on your energy body to allow the Kundalini energy to go up, activating each chakra (energy center). Once this potent energy is activated, the healing and transformation begins. The more the kundalini energy moves through our body, the more  our physical, emotional, mental and spiritual wellbeing is improved. This energy transmission is incomparable with anything you’ve tried before!💥  Gabriela also uses Sound Healing as a part of this process to bring additional frequencies for you to go deeper into this powerfully healing experience. Benefits of Kundalini Awakening:  ✨ Emotional Healing:  - Releasing of deeply-rooted emotional blockages and traumas - Profound healing and de-programming of old beliefs - Reduced stress and anxiety ✨ Physical Healing:  - Feeling lighter and more grounded in your physical body - Improved physical health & bringing your body into balance and harmony - Reduced tension in your body ✨Spiritual Evolution:   - Reconnection with your higher self - Heart opening and profound sense of oneness/connection to the Source - A deeper connection to your purpose &  your inner power ✨ Personal Growth: - A natural positive change in your behaviour and habits - Profound insights and clarity on your life  - Increased creativity and intuition About the Event:  We'll start our journey with a sharing circle to connect to each other and set our intentions for the session.

With Gabriela, I’ve been able to connect to past traumas, transcending this current life and finally heal to create space for new beginnings.   Gabriela’s sessions have become my regular spiritual practice. Every Monday I leave feeling lighter and ready to take on the week ahead. Last night felt like we were creating heaven on earth!  Thank you, Gabriela for holding a safe space for healing, release, growth and community support. I’m forever grateful! Can't wait for next Monday ❤️""  Bruna S. ""I’ve been attending Gabriela’s Kundalini classes for several months now. What I love most about the Kundalini is that it totally bypasses the conscious mind in a way that few other modalities do. Whether you come with a clear intention or not – the Kundalini energy will work its magic. Gabriela’s classes allowed me to release trapped emotions I didn’t even know I had and I always leave feeling very peaceful and connected to myself on a deep level. The difference it has made to my life and business has been outstanding. I am no longer living in fear or living in the past and my self-confidence has grown ten-fold. In fact, Gabriela has been so beneficial to my personal development that I’ve begun seeing her for private sessions.  I cannot recommend Gabriela’s Kundalini Activation classes highly enough."" Stewart W. ""Wow! Just wow! After the first session, I was absolutely blown away for which has kept me going back for the past 6 months on a regular basis."" Antonio F. ""I had a fantastic healing session with Gabriela last Monday. I came in being overwhelmed with my emotional pain and feeling worthless, needing to release my emotions and get in touch with my inner self again.  I felt great energy going through my body during the healing ceremony and I experienced 3 huge emotional releases. Leaving the session feeling lighter, detached from pain and peaceful was an incredible start to my personal healing journey.  Gabriela’s healing skills are amazing and I will keep returning to her sessions.""  Martina  P. ""During the session, the energy was absolutely beautiful! Gabriela released my energy blockages and I could feel great energy flowing through my body. I felt so much lighter and at peace after the session."" Malcolm W. ""I came with my sister and it was my very first kundalini session. I completely let go of my mind to wonder and my body to express, it was an amazing feeling. I found that Gabriela was able to activate all our senses through her session. The music was very powerful, the sounds of instruments, the scents she was spreading in the room, her touches to our body to activate other parts of our body and energy. It was really incredible! I personally was looking to find myself again after my transition to becoming a mother. After giving birth to my son, I needed to let go of a lot of pressure and sense of responsibilities, it really felt good and I felt all the energy travelling through my body getting rid of all the tension and negativity. My shoulders were shaking as if it was ejecting all the tension and everything I had been carrying for years. I even saw my soul which was pretty amazing. After the session, I felt so much lighter and ready to move on to my new chapter of life as a mom but without forgetting myself. Thank you Gabriela!""  Aurelie Z.

Organizations are critically dependent on information technology (IT) to better support their business goals. Risk management plays a critical role in protecting an organization’s information assets, and its mission therein, from IT-related risk. An effective risk management process is an important component of a successful IT security program. The principal goal of an organization’s risk management process should be to protect the organization and its ability to perform their mission, not just its IT assets. Therefore, the risk management process should not be treated primarily as a technical function carried out by the IT experts who operate and manage the IT system, but as an essential management function of the organization. Risk is the net negative impact of the exercise of a vulnerability, considering both the probability and the impact of occurrence. Risk management is the process of identifying risk, assessing risk, and taking steps to reduce risk to an acceptable level. This course provides an overview into the specific criteria, steps and actions necessary to implement and sustain a comprehensive Information Risk Management program. Learning Objectives: After completing this course, you will be able to: Address various risk methodologies and assess application to individual enterprise environments.

Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7.

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right?

The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials?

NA,Sold out,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

Your business competitors are not only working on stealing your customers away from you, they are also working on stealing your best employees from you. You are competing against other employers to attract and keep high quality employees. And your best employees? In this knowledge based economy, best employees know the key to their own long term well-being is their own skill set. They are hungry for knowledge, for wisdom, they want what's in your head, and they want you to make their learning experience inspirational not painful. If you refuse to teach them, if you are not effective at coaching, or if it's unpleasant to learn under you (you are a typical tyrant of a boss from 1950 LOL) they will quit and go somewhere else for the learning experience.

NA,Sold out,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

And a big part of what you have to teach, is wisdom, insights, human nature, understanding of business. Good economy, bad economy, bad employees are dime a dozen. Good employees? Your business competitors are not only working on stealing your customers away from you, they are also working on stealing your best employees from you. You are competing against other employers to attract and keep high quality employees. And your best employees? In this knowledge based economy, best employees know the key to their own long term well-being is their own skill set. They are hungry for knowledge, for wisdom, they want what's in your head, and they want you to make their learning experience inspirational not painful. If you refuse to teach them, if you are not effective at coaching, or if it's unpleasant to learn under you (you are a typical tyrant of a boss from 1950 LOL) they will quit and go somewhere else for the learning experience.

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

You will also develop many of the skills and techniques that will help you to use the structure effectively. Course Contents:  The selection of new employees can be a long drawn out and expensive process.  This means that we must do everything we can to ensure that when we do make a decision we choose the right person. Having gone through all the trouble of working through a selection process there is nothing worse than taking on a new employee who turns out to be unsuitable. A robust selection process will minimize the risk of this happening and, of course, effective interviewing needs to be part of that. If you handle selection interviewing in a logical, structured, and professional way the risk of choosing the wrong person is much smaller. This interview skills training concentrates on developing interview techniques. Although we will briefly touch on the laws of discrimination a detailed discussion of it is outside of the scope of this program. Similarly, the topics of Diversity and Equality of Opportunity will only be covered briefly. We concentrate on competency based interviewing skills in this training. This is sometimes described as behavioral, situational, or job related interviewing. Course Topics: Similar Circles – This icebreaker requires some listening and questioning and therefore provides a very relevant start to the training. The Selection Interview – We explain what a selection interview is with particular reference to competency based interviewing. The learners then participate in an activity to identify the benefits and drawbacks of this approach before looking at ways to overcome those drawbacks. Diversity and Equality of Opportunity – In this brief look at the topic Yare reminded of the importance of treating job candidates fairly. The PRICE structure – Learners are introduced to our PRICE structure. PRICE organization – In this activity learners consider 37 action cards that describe behaviors and techniques that may be used by interviewers. Their task is to fit these cards within the context of the PRICE structure. This will help them to develop a good understanding of PRICE and how they may be able to use it. Wrinkle Chaser – You conduct a short interview activity to demonstrate the difficulty of interviewing without adequate preparation. The Selection Process – Learners are reminded that interviews are a part of a selection process and do not normally stand alone Question Plans – Preparing a question plan is identified as key to good preparation. Participants are encouraged to use a structured approach supported by our Question Plan template. First Impressions – Learners take part in activities to help them consider both the importance of making the right first impressions on candidates and the danger that interviewers can be unduly influenced by their first impressions of interviewees. We also look at rapport building at the start of the interview. Traffic Lights – In this activity learners consider nine different question types and decide whether they should be used in interviews. Effective Listening – Learners identify barriers to effective listening and ways to overcome those barriers. The Close Phase – This provides advice on what to cover with the candidate at the end of the interview. The Evaluation Phase – Learners are encouraged to suspend judgement until the interview is over. They are then taken through an approach for evaluating and scoring the interview linked to their question plan. Interview Practice – Learners take part in two or three interview simulations. They act as interviewer once and then as an interviewee and/or observer. Each of these roles gives them a different perspective of interviewing and will help them to apply the principles covered in this programme when they conduct real selection interviews in the workplace.

Leading Effective Teams Training: This training based on leading teams will help you to develop anyone that leads a team or is involved in a leadership role.

Your participants will understand that training is a process where skills, knowledge, and attitudes are applied in a unique way. Presentation Skills Training: In a survey carried out amongst experienced, middle and senior executives, designed to determine the things that they feared most, public speaking came out as number one.

Practical Sales Skills Training: These practical sales skills training has been developed for salespeople or people who are required to sell as part of their role. This course is applicable for both people relatively new to sales as well as those who have a lot of experience as the content is flexible enough to adapt to suit the audience. Conflict Management Training: Disagreements, differences of opinion and conflicting perspectives on key issues inevitably arise in any context where people are working together. Research has shown that workplace conflicts can become highly destructive. Negative emotions may be stirred up, poisoning team morale, creating stress and destroying relationships. Power Query and Power Pivot for Excel Training: Power BI (including Power Query & Power Pivot) are the biggest Excel news items in the last 10 years. They give Excel users the power to draw information out of multiple sources, link it together then perform calculations on it that can then be sliced & diced any way you want. Essential Management Skills Training: Every day, managers solve difficult problems, turn organisations around, and achieve astonishing performance. To be successful, every organisation needs good managers. Manager Management  Training: With this course, you will be able to provide the skills, guidance, and empowerment to your team of managers.

Sales Presentation Mastery Training: Sales are the absolute most essential component of any business, and selling skills are the most highly valued skills in today’s business landscape. The world's fastest growing and most successful businesses have one thing in common: they have effective sales people that drive their business forward. Time Management Training: Personal time management skills are essential for professional success in any workplace.

These highly effective individuals are able to focus on the tasks with the greatest impact to them and their organization.

In the context of the notorious decline in legal protection of industrial action across the globe, the project explores what role the right to strike could and should play in contemporary domestic and transnational labour markets. A first convening meeting for the project has been held, which more than forty experts attended in person and online. One output of the project is a special issue of a journal (the International Labour Review) and a second will be an open access multi-authored book designed to be accessible to those seeking to engage in right to strike litigation and lobbying.

I m a strong believer in using what you have and what you have learnt, and putting it into practice. I like to use my imagination to create beautiful things. My artworks are all related to everything in life that fascinates me and always overwhelmed me with excitement. I need their stories to be told through my art. Some of my subjects are darker but I like to share the different sides of them.

F﻿or those of us working the 12 steps, our experiences working them is that they often are not linear steps and throughout our recovery journey we move backwards and forwards through them for the rest of our lives as a way of life.  In this way, the eight limbs of Yoga are very similar to the 12 steps offering very similar ideas using different language. Yoga helps to inform our recovery and take it deeper still, bringing us back to our bodies through mindfulness and gently reminding us that we are on a path of recovery, healing and self discovery using time tested ancient practises. Recovery Yoga builds on the emotional and psychosocial skills we learn working the 12 steps in order for our needs as human beings to be met. The addition of a regular Yoga practise then invites the care and love for the body, self awareness, personal development, spiritual connection and connection to your like minded community.
