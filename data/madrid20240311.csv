NA,Sold out,NA,"Leica Gallery Madrid exhibe hasta el próximo 20 de abril, “Los Mexicanos” de Bernardo Aja. Bernardo Aja ha recorrido el país buscando las características específicas que definen la rica variedad de la fiesta brava en México, especialmente en ciudades conocidas por su arquitectura barroca de origen español o su casco antiguo de época colonial. No obstante, a pesar de la influencia española, la tauromaquia ha ido adquiriendo características propias. Los toros en México se viven de otro modo. ¿Qué busca el fotógrafo frente al toro? Desvelar el carácter psicológico de su retratado. Lo mismo que busca el torero frente al toro: desvelar el carácter psicológico del animal para poder anticipar sus reacciones, sus manías, sus filias o fobias… En ello le va la vida. En cuanto a los matadores, en esta serie de fotografías no aparecen «las figuras del toreo». Aquí vemos a toreros modestos que muy probablemente nunca lleguen a vestirse de luces en lujosos hoteles; toreros que nunca pisarán moqueta; toreros que se juegan la vida en plazas fascinantes como la Petatera, levantada por el pueblo siguiendo antiquísimas técnicas provenientes de ancestrales arquitecturas indígenas. ¿Representa este tipo de construcción un anacronismo en pleno siglo XXI? Seguramente. Las fotografías de Bernardo Aja son testimonio de unos ritos y costumbres que vienen de lejos. A día de hoy, la ancestral ceremonia táurica sigue siendo un hecho socio-cultural de innegable arraigo en las tradiciones de nuestros respectivos pueblos, fundamentalmente porque a través del toreo logran expresar rasgos profundos de sus modos de ser.

Estos cursos, talleres, seminarios, retiros y resto de actividades permiten descubrir, ordenar, profundizar y desarrollar nuestro mundo interno, al par que nos ayudan a producir cambios de conducta que nos facilitan la relación y comprensión de otras personas y de nosotros mismos, aunque de ninguna manera tienen como objetivo una finalidad terapéutica o similar.

 CURSO 1º DE PASOS DE MEDITACIÓN: LA MIRADA INTERNA
 TEMÁTICA
 ¿Es que acaso el órgano de la visión no está colocado para atisbar el mundo exterior, como si fuera una ventana o dos, si fuera el caso; no está colocado para abrirse cada día al despertar de la conciencia? El fondo del ojo recibe los impactos del mundo exterior. Pero a veces, cuando cierro los párpados, recuerdo al mundo externo, o lo imagino, o lo ensueño, o lo sueño. A este mundo lo veo con un ojo interior que también mira en una pantalla, pero que no es la correspondiente al mundo externo...
 
 MÉTODO DE TRABAJO Y TEMARIO CADA REUNIÓN_ Exposición de temas y herramientas. Prácticas en reunión y realizadas durante la semana. Intercambio sobre la práctica conjunta: Logros y dificultades. Prácticas de aprendizaje de Relax físico externo, Relax físico interno, Relax mental y Meditación.

Orla pasó 16 años en Bruselas y ahora vive y trabaja en el sudeste de Irlanda, donde cuida de un rebaño de ovejas de pura raza Lleyn. Su obra aborda las tensiones entre el ser de la artista y la ecoagricultora en la Irlanda rural. El cuidado de las ovejas ha ralentizado su carrera artística, pero, al mismo tiempo, ha supuesto una enorme fuente de inspiración para la misma. Se evade del estudio con las ovejas y escapa de las ovejas refugiándose en su estudio. Notes from Sheepland nos acerca a Orla y su deambular entre ambos mundos.

Notes from Sheepland bursts with candid observations of lipstick wearing,always swearing, no nonsense, artist and shepherd, Orla Barry. Orla lived in Brussels for 16 years and now lives and works in South East Ireland where she runs a flock of pedigree Lleyn sheep. Her work deals with the tensions of being an artist and an eco-farmer in rural Ireland. The sheep have slowed her art career but at the same time, caring for them has hugely inspired it. She escapes the studio by going to the sheep, escapes the sheep by hiding in her studio. Notes from Sheepland follows Orla as she floats between these worlds.
