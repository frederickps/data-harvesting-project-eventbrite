NA,Sold out,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class! Or come back to the class if you get interrupted! 1: Delegation Skills for Busy Leaders - Why & How 2: How To Motivate & Inspire Your Employees?

Your business competitors are not only working on stealing your customers away from you, they are also working on stealing your best employees from you.

They are hungry for knowledge, for wisdom, they want what's in your head, and they want you to make their learning experience inspirational not painful. If you refuse to teach them, if you are not effective at coaching, or if it's unpleasant to learn under you (you are a typical tyrant of a boss from 1950 LOL) they will quit and go somewhere else for the learning experience.

The purpose of this yoga lineage is to guide you toward cultivating a conscious connection, integration and awakening of the body, mind, heart and spirit. You will learn and practice Patanjali's 8 limbs of yoga: Work primarily with the Amrit posture sequence, gentle vinyasa flows and extended posture holding times. Explore the deepest levels of body, mind and spirit with the integrative practices of clear intention, breath, meditative awareness and conscious integration. Learn to balance your nervous system with the ‚Äúfirst half‚Äù and ‚Äúsecond half‚Äù of a posture. To transition from an active state of ‚Äúdoing‚Äù a posture, to a relaxed state of ‚Äúbeing‚Äù. And to feel the effects of a posture. Learn to consciously encounter your ""edge"" of body and mind to release deep tensions and restore the natural flow of the vital life force energy (prana). Good for all levels, from those with some experience to more experienced practitioners. Some experience with yoga and postures is recommended.

NA,Sold out,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

Our internal world drives our external world. Our ability to use our mind determines how well we can control our external realities. What you may not know is that our Minds have an identity. Creating an Identity of mind allows us to direct our external world intentionally. The language we use to run our lives is one dimensional, which creates needless limitations. Our minds work best in a multidimensional language. Learning how to access your minds resources correctly will enable you to create a life beyond who we desire to be. Our vocabulary, are words we use internally to motivate change, but instead of encouraging us, the imperfections in our speech and articulation restrict access to our minds. There is no synchronicity between the one-dimensional language in our speech and the 4 th dimension of the mind. If you‚Äôre not using the correct language of the mind, the mind disengages where we become confused. We don‚Äôt have the language to describe the life that we want in a way that the mind accepts, understands, and can utilise.

The purpose of this yoga lineage is to guide you toward cultivating a conscious connection, integration and awakening of the body, mind, heart and spirit. You will learn and practice Patanjali's 8 limbs of yoga: Work primarily with the Amrit posture sequence, gentle vinyasa flows and extended posture holding times. Explore the deepest levels of body, mind and spirit with the integrative practices of clear intention, breath, meditative awareness and conscious integration. Learn to balance your nervous system with the ‚Äúfirst half‚Äù and ‚Äúsecond half‚Äù of a posture. To transition from an active state of ‚Äúdoing‚Äù a posture, to a relaxed state of ‚Äúbeing‚Äù. And to feel the effects of a posture. Learn to consciously encounter your ""edge"" of body and mind to release deep tensions and restore the natural flow of the vital life force energy (prana). Good for all levels, from those with some experience to more experienced practitioners. Some experience with yoga and postures is recommended.

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

Our ability to use our mind determines how well we can control our external realities. What you may not know is that our Minds have an identity. Creating an Identity of mind allows us to direct our external world intentionally. The language we use to run our lives is one dimensional, which creates needless limitations. Our minds work best in a multidimensional language. Learning how to access your minds resources correctly will enable you to create a life beyond who we desire to be. Our vocabulary, are words we use internally to motivate change, but instead of encouraging us, the imperfections in our speech and articulation restrict access to our minds. There is no synchronicity between the one-dimensional language in our speech and the 4 th dimension of the mind. If you‚Äôre not using the correct language of the mind, the mind disengages where we become confused.
