NA,Sold out,Rimborsi fino a 7 giorni prima dell'evento,"Siamo costituiti da due tipi di energie: le più grossolane prodotte dai cibi ingeriti e le più sottili, prese dall'ambiente esterno. Gli organi non sono solo unità capaci di immagazzinare, trasformare e distribuire energia; fanno parte di meccanismi più sottili gestiti in maniera equilibrata da corpo mente e anima. Gestire male questi aspetti ci conduce alla malattia. Sapere di cosa si occupi ogni singolo organo ci permetterà di effettuare i cambiamenti profondi su di se stessi. Guardando alla malattia in un nuovo modo, comprenderemo quali siano i comportamenti da cambiare affinché la malattia possa arrestarsi e talvolta regredire. Per favorire il riequilibrio,  Luca Apicella, studioso di spicosomatica integrale di Dahlkle e counselor a indirizzo psicosomatico, ha ideato il metodo che verrà insegnato durante il corso RRP: R: Riconoscere il messaggio dell'organo; R: Risolvere il problema comportamentale P: Mettere in pratica il cambiamento. Le problematiche e le malattie individuate in un organo diventeranno il meccanismo per cambiare i nostri comportamenti avvicinandoci alla felicità, riconoscendo una direzione di vita che finora, probabilmente, non abbiamo individuato. Un lavoro che ha richiesto molti mesi di stesura e ispirato agli scritti del dottor R. Dahlke dove è stata reso più semplice, intuitivo e fruibile il lavoro simbolico sugli organi e sulle patologie. Questo modulo è aperto a tutti e parte integrante del Percorso formativo completo di Cristalloterapia e del Percorso formativo completo di Reiki Usui dell'anno accademico in corso. Programma Giorno 1 Imparare a riconoscere le funzioni simboliche profonde degli organi: anima e   corpo sono uniti. Giorno 2 Imparare a riconoscere le patologie degli organi studiati.

MIXING IDENTITIES analyzes the hidden parts of our identities, through an immersive experience inside the fascinating universe of the complex labyrinths of our consciousness. The human body is a changing system that connects us with other bodies and spaces to perceive the surrounding reality; a strong communication system with its own language and infinite ways of expression.

Here, painful note, it is really dirty and bulky of all kinds of materials, probably also residues dating back to the construction sites of the freeway, present some do in this area. Fortunately, the situation improves, and very long along the true shore where, apart from some unmistakable plastic envelope hanging on the branches, the situation is quite natural. We can then decide whether to fish back or down to the valley without any substantial differences in catch possibilities. Keep in mind, however, that the great majority of the visitors stops near the bridge and in the quiet adjacent slope so this area is the most beaten and disturbed. Thanks to the supply of different streams coming from the small side valleys, the flow of water flows here consistently maintains a good consistency and the quality of the liquid element, partly due to the influence of the waters coming from the reclamation of the Fucino, collected from the upstream Liri (certainly not potable but still improving due to the intensification of the controls on the industrial discharges carried out by the prescribed organs) is acceptable, as well as acceptable is the transparency of the same. The appearance is typical of the middle Apennine stream with alternating scrapers, slopes where the water slows, rarer holes with deeper depths. The backdrop is everywhere bowl, rarely sandy, in some stretches the current is broken by larger boulders that slow it down, forming good rifugi for the pinnuta. The shores, though with varied plants and vegetation, are still quite practicable, especially in the winter - early spring; However, they also have traits that a real river fisherman would call ""comfortable."" As mentioned earlier, it is now some years that this stretch of river is in concession to the Annalasia headquarters in Avezzano (along with some stretches of canals belonging to the Bonifica del Fucino); the continuity of management with its repopulations and controls results in some results in terms of fish populations. Obvious signs of aquatic life are noticed only in the case of insects that cause fish to surface activity, however, even if the season is not in season because of the fact that this trait has been granted to the same operator for years and that this operator performs good sowing (including in an extremely ""transparent way"" by giving early notice to anyone who wants to assist you), the population of fario is consolidated; besides the trout we find chubs and some shrubbery. To be able to fish in the 4 Km in concession, you must be registered at the A.P.T. (a national card of € 30.00 for the year 2017, including insurance coverage against accidents related to the completion of fishing activities) and to possess a booklet for travelers (Euro 30 for the year 2017), in the remainder the fishing is free and subject to the regulations in force in Abruzzo for category ""A"" waters. For the above, you can go to the area's fishing stores (for example, ALO 'A. GO TO GO TOURS - Rome Tel. 0633611954) who will deliver us a card or booklet for the traveler; showing the receipt of the postal payment for the fishing license and identity card you can fish. They may also provide us with information on the changes of the last hour to the regulations described. In the concession section, the regulations in force are essentially those provided by the Abruzzo Region Code for Category A waters. The maximum number of catches of salmonids per fishing day (strictly to be noted on the booklet of the Signature Act) is 5 trout. Fishing is practicable every day except on Tuesdays and Thursdays when it does not fall in conjunction with a holiday. The abstract of the regulation is however reported on the tagacatture card. The places in question, except for the first few weeks of the season, are never particularly crowded. As always, the practicable / advisable technique conflicts with the preferences of the individual, however, it can be safely stated that the site is well suited to fishing with artificial lures (spinning and fly), even though it has characters so that they also give space to fans of other specialties, also bearing in mind that the latter (forbidden the bigatino), will also undermine the troupe roommates (chubby and barbie) that can represent a fun alternative. To conclude the site described can therefore be a good reference for early season exit but also a valid destination for all the rest of the year (perhaps for fly fishing), preserving, as already mentioned, an acceptable range and population year.

Itinerari pesca Abruzzo: fiume Liri - Valle Roveto (AQ)
Oggetto di questo itinerario è il tratto del fiume delimitato, a monte, dal confine fra i comuni di S.Vincenzo Valle Roveto e Balsorano e, a valle, da quello fra la Provincia dell'Aquila e quella di Frosinone.E' costeggiato interamente dalla S.S. n. 82 della Valle Roveto e letteralmente sovrastato dalla Superstrada del Liri che scorre su di una serie di viadotti che attraversano più volte il fiume; l'intera zona, da anni era in concessione all'Enalpesca sede di Avezzano (AQ) Tel. 0863 21029. Dal 2006 (Dal 2017 in concessione a SEROTONIN dalle sorgenti fino al confine regionale) l'estensione della concessione è stata ridotta ed attualmente si estende complessivamente per 4 Km. dalla Centrale Idroelettrica di Balsorano verso valle sino alla località ""Le Cave""; dopo questi 4 Km., e sino al confine di Provincia, le acque risultano in concessione a SEROTONIN e sono quindi sempre di categoria ""A"". Per raggiungere il punto “centrale” del tratto di fiume in oggetto conviene percorrere la Superstrada prima citata sino all’uscita di Balsorano, qui immettersi sulla S.S. 82 in direzione Sora, attraversare l’abitato di Balsorano e dopo circa 2 chilometri svoltare a destra in direzione Collepiano, oltrepassato il ponte che attraversa il Liri, possiamo svoltare a sinistra (direzione C.da Pistola, strada comunale Le Compre) e, percorse ancora alcune centinaia di metri, trovare posto per l’auto in una delle numerose piazzole poste al di sotto dei viadotti della superstrada. Qui, nota dolente, è veramente sporchissimo ed ingombro di ogni genere di materiali, probabilmente anche residui risalenti ai cantieri di costruzione della superstrada, presenti qualche hanno fa in questa zona. Fortunatamente la situazione migliora, e di molto lungo la sponda vera e propria dove, a parte qualche immancabile busta di plastica appesa ai rami, la situazione si presenta abbastanza naturale. Possiamo quindi decidere se pescare a risalire o a scendere verso valle senza sostanziali differenze di possibilità di cattura. Da tenere presente comunque che la grande maggioranza dei frequentatori si ferma nei pressi del ponte e nella tranquilla spianata adiacente quindi, questa zona è la più battuta e disturbata.Grazie all’apporto di diversi torrentelli provenienti dalle piccole valli laterali la portata del corso d’acqua, qui, mantiene costantemente una buona consistenza e la qualità dell’elemento liquido, pur risentendo parzialmente dell’influsso delle acque provenienti dalla bonifica del Fucino, raccolte dal Liri più a monte (non certo potabili ma comunque in via di miglioramento grazie all’intensificarsi dei controlli sugli scarichi industriali espletati dagli organi preposti), è accettabile, così come accettabile è la trasparenza delle stesse.L’aspetto è quello tipico del medio torrente appenninico con alternanza di raschi, spianate in cui l’acqua rallenta, più rare buche con maggiore profondità. Il fondale è ovunque ciotoloso, raramente sabbioso, in alcuni tratti la corrente è spezzata da massi più grandi che la rallentano costituendo buoni rifugi per i pinnuti.Le sponde, pur con la presenza di piante e vegetazione varia, risultano comunque abbastanza praticabili, soprattutto nel periodo inverno – inizio primavera; presentano comunque anche tratti che un vero pescatore di torrente definirebbe “comodi”. Come detto prima sono ormai alcuni anni che questo tratto di fiume è in concessione all’Enalpesca sede di Avezzano (unitamente ad alcuni tratti di canali appartenenti alla Bonifica del Fucino); la continuità della gestione con i relativi ripopolamenti e controlli sortisce quindi qualche risultato in ordine al popolamento ittico. Segni evidenti di vita acquatica se ne scorgono pochi se non a stagione avanzata, in occasione di particolari schiuse di insetti ,che inducono i pesci ad una attività superficiale, comunque, anche in conseguenza del fatto che questo tratto è in concessione allo stesso gestore da anni e che tale gestore effettua delle buone semine (tra l'altro in maniera estremamente ""trasparente"" dandone notizia anticipatamente per permettere a chiunque lo voglia di assistervi), la popolazione di fario è consolidata ; oltre alle trote troviamo cavedani e qualche barbo. Per poter pescare nei 4 Km. in concessione, era necessario essere iscritti all’Enalpesca (tessera nazionale del costo di 10,00 Euro, per l’anno 2006, comprendente anche una copertura assicurativa contro gli infortuni connessi all’espletamento dell’attività di pesca) ed essere in possesso del libretto segnacatture (costo Euro 25,82 per l’anno 2006); (per l’anno 2017 ad oggi, e nel futuro, è necessario essere in possesso del biglietto/Ticket Eventbrite internazionale del costo di 10,00 Euro al giorno + spese ed essere in possesso del libretto segnacatture costo Euro 5,00) nel rimanente tratto la pesca è biglietto/Ticket Eventbrite e soggetta ai regolamenti vigenti in Abruzzo per le acque di categoria ""A"". Per quanto sopra ci si può rivolgere ai negozi di pesca della zona (ad esempio SEROTONIN – Roma Tel. 328 1116276) che ci consegneranno i bollettini (prestampati e prenumerati) necessari per l’effettuazione dei versamenti e provvederanno al rilascio della licenza e del libretto segnacatture esibendogli le ricevute di tali versamenti unitamente alla licenza di pesca governativa in corso di validità. Gli stessi potranno inoltre fornirci indicazioni su variazioni dell'ultim'ora ai regolamenti descritti. Nel tratto in concessione i regolamenti vigenti sono sostanzialmente quelli previsti, dalla legge regionale abruzzese per le acque di categoria A con qualche ulteriore restrizione fra cui, da rilevare, il divieto di entrare in acqua, da cui sono esclusi coloro che praticano la pesca a mosca con la coda di topo. Il numero massimo di catture di salmonidi, per giornata di pesca (rigorosamente da annotare sul libretto segnacatture), è di 5 esemplari poi si puo' continuare in NO-KILL. La pesca è praticabile tutti i giorni esclusi il martedì e giovedì quando non ricadenti in concomitanza con una festività. Estratto del regolamento è comunque riportato sul tesserino segnacatture. I luoghi in questione, ad eccezione delle prime settimane della stagione, non sono mai particolarmente affollati. Come sempre, l’argomento tecniche praticabili/consigliabili si scontra con le preferenze del singolo, comunque si può affermare con certezza che il luogo si presta decisamente alla pesca con esche artificiali (spinning e mosca), pur presentando caratteristiche tali da lasciar spazio anche agli appassionati di altre specialità, tenendo inoltre presente che, questi ultimi (vietatissimo il bigattino), potranno insidiare anche i coinquilini delle trote (cavedani e barbi) che possono rappresentare una divertente alternativa. Per concludere il luogo descritto può quindi rappresentare un buon riferimento per le uscite di inizio stagione ma anche una valida meta tutto il resto dell’anno (magari per chi pesca a mosca), conservando, come già detto, una portata ed un popolamento accettabile tutto l’anno.",https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fiume-liri-abruzzo-italia-tickets-58929958091,roma

Arthur ha un talento raro: riesce a percepire, come un rabdomante, la presenza delle tombe etrusche che costellano il litorale tirrenico, virtù apprezzata dai suoi amici tombaroli in cerca di reperti da rivendere al mercato nero. Ma mentre loro inseguono un profitto di sopravvivenza che non li renderà mai ricchi (perché quello è il ""talento"" dei grandi trafficanti), ""l'inglese"" è alla disperata ricerca di un passaggio verso l'aldilà che potrebbe ricongiungerlo a Beniamina, la ragazza che ha amato e perduto. Italia, a dispetto del nome, è straniera come Arthur, ed è l'unica in grado di accendere nel giovane uomo un nuovo interesse per la vita. Va a stanarlo sulle pendici della città, dove vive in una baracca che solo lei trova bella, e solleva il suo sguardo da quella terra che lo attira come un magnete. Italia è anche l'unica ad intravvedere, fra gli incroci dei rami che paiono bacchette da rabdomante, il fantasma di certi uomini appesi a testa in giù, rivolti verso il mondo di sotto come Orfei irresistibilmente attratti da una loro Euridice.
