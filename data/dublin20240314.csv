Once time is up, the ladies remain seated and the gents move down a spot and take a seat at the table of their next potential match. On each date, the daters will write down their dates name and will later check off if they are interested in the match. Make sure your date card is filled out correctly, hand it back to our host at the end of the eventing, and leave the rest to us. Just because the event is over doesn’t mean your night has to be! Feel free to stay for a drink (or two). Kick back, relax, and maybe chat further with some of the other daters from our speed dating event.

The Damned Don’t Cry (1950) Screens 7 March at  7.00 Joan Crawford contributed to the script which was loosely based on the life of social-climber and Bugsy Siegel’s main squeeze, Virginia Hill. Joan spends the run-time in a quest for good taste and a life of her own. After leaving a bitter husband in the rear-view, she sells cigars, models clothes, and dallies with important men. Joan becomes the kind of quality dame who matches appropriate flowers for the time of day. In one scene, she scoffs at the flower box in Steve Cochran’s hands: ‘I don’t care for orchids in the afternoon.’ Mister 880 (1950) Screens 14 March at 7.00 On one level, the picture adapts a classic New Yorker essay about a counterfeiter who eluded capture for years. In the middle of the manhunt, a sparkling romance develops between Dorothy McGuire and Burt Lancaster. Screenwriter Robert Riskin had been a master of the ‘meet cute’ for nearly twenty years. Looking for any excuse to prolong contact with the broad-shouldered G-man, Dorothy makes herself a suspect in the investigation by learning antiquated forgerer’s slang, such as ‘boodle of queer.’ Tomorrow Is Another Day (1951) Screens 21 March at 7.00 Ruth Roman plays a platinum blonde taxi dancer kept under the thumb of a shady police detective. One night in the club, she picks up Steve Cochran, a chaste ex-con who seems like an easy touch for presents. Hardboiled and world-weary, Ruth realises that Steve is as innocent as a polished apple. After the cop is killed in her apartment, she lets Steve think he pulled the trigger. The star-crossed lovers on the run find refuge among farm workers. Can they make a fresh start? Or will the law catch up with them? Peyton Place (1957) Screens 28 March at 7.00 Lana Turner’s star power summoned box office gold and the sole Best Actress nomination that she received during a long career. Lana kept the lights on at Twentieth Century Fox when the studio was almost bankrupt by the competition from television. The lush melodrama was based on the best-selling novel by Grace Metalious, an impoverished young housewife who lived without running water and fed a family of five on $20 a week. Peyton Place stirred controversy with a frank depiction of taboo topics such as rape, incest, and abortion.

Dante stands among the most influential and widely read authors in western literature, and his poem rewards readers with insights into a medieval world that often appears just as familiar as it does strange in its depiction of human experience. Join us in sharing Dante's vision as we accompany him on his ultra-terrestrial journey, meeting souls whose challenges on earth strongly resemble those of our own. No prior knowledge of Dante or Italian is required, and we will read the poem in English translation, paying close attention to Dante's cultural and historical context as well as to his poetic strategies. Readers of all backgrounds and disciplines are welcome and are encouraged to find and reflect on the poem’s enduring relevance for themselves and for readers in the 21st century. The group meets every two weeks during term from 12-2pm at Trinity Centre for Literary and Cultural Translation, 36 Fenian St, Dublin, D02 CH22. It is not possible to join online.  Please remember to register for each session you would like to attend. A bilingual edition of the text will be presented at each session, and attendees are welcome to bring their own editions. Robin Kirkpatrick's translation for Penguin is recommended, as are the translations by Durling & Martinez or Robert and Jean Hollander. Sessions are led by Dante scholar and Fellow Emeritus Corinna Salvadori Lonergan and John Walsh, an IRC Government of Ireland Scholar in Comparative Literature (German/Italian), both of Trinity College Dublin. Remaining sessions: Purgatorio (14 March 2024); Paradiso 28 March and 11 April 2024.  Organised by Corinna Salvadori Lonergan, Céline Thobois-Gupta and John Walsh, in collaboration with the Trinity Centre for Literary and Cultural Translation.

NA,Refunds up to 7 days before event,"“Phase deep into the Night to break high into the Light”. “The MIND is a product of its KNOWING, not its THOUGHTS nor its THINKING, for they are easy to be influenced by the external world, but the Mind which is internal, is NOT them”. Mind ReMapping You may read this today and wonder, what values can we learn from Mind ReMapping? Your Mind is an atomic and perpetual energy. Its power is so complex that it carries no mass, but yet, derives energy not only from the natural sustainability of surrounding environments, but it perpetuates far greater power with the connections it makes with other minds where at our collective nucleus, is a nuclear energy which is unstoppable. This power, which for most of us is dormant, inspires its own potent energies, deriving power from genuine and respectful gestures we gift through the interactions we have with one another, in the simplest of, “Hellos, & how are you?” Its only through a connection with other minds, not money, nor possessions, that can pull us out of our lowest moments in life’s darkness, because nothing, not even FEAR, can survive the deep depths of Time, where FEAR abandons us to insanity or, we find salvation through a connection with other minds. However, the mind's energy when synchronised is unrivalled, as there is nothing more gargantuan than collective minds coming together because the mind must first perceive before it can conceive. Collective Minds that are empathic to one another are designed to create wormholes in Time, where either the greatest ideas are birthed, or where our worst nightmares are channelled through time. Wormholes in Time, of course, can be achieved in their singularities which can be truly exhilarating or horrific, but the wormholes we create together, open vaster passages in Time through which powers of Consciousness can manifest itself to us, in whatever we have asked it to become. That power to some, can present itself to be God, to some, it can be Spirituality, and to others, it can be the Sciences, the Arts, or any means where Consciousness can reach us through OPEN TIME. Imagine these wormholes as transmission gateways to higher or lower Dimensions, that for humans, are situated in the only place where Time can travel, whilst carrying our perceptions with it. That place is the 4 Dimensions of our Minds. At this point, we realise why our minds are so powerful because they are PORTALS of TIME, and why, we are often kept divided, pitting advantages against one another over trivial conflicts, because we have forgotten who we are. We are not aware we are lowering our status as a species which redirects Times energy toward alternative sources that close time, straining and weakening mind transmissions. However, what is being attempted above all our own primitive needs, is that certain Timelines of Consciousness are being fragmented. Consciousness is an intelligence of unities, where strength in numbers creates infinities which either, flourish in life, or instead, are infinities that perpetuate repetitive downward spirals. The next revolution is not going to be the takeover of A.I. as we are sold and told because it is too obvious, it instead, will be the invisible Decimations of minds only looking out for themselves, or it will be the Raptures of people who know their Minds, bringing Times of life, together.

NA,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

And a big part of what you have to teach, is wisdom, insights, human nature, understanding of business. Good economy, bad economy, bad employees are dime a dozen. Good employees? Your business competitors are not only working on stealing your customers away from you, they are also working on stealing your best employees from you. You are competing against other employers to attract and keep high quality employees. And your best employees? In this knowledge based economy, best employees know the key to their own long term well-being is their own skill set. They are hungry for knowledge, for wisdom, they want what's in your head, and they want you to make their learning experience inspirational not painful. If you refuse to teach them, if you are not effective at coaching, or if it's unpleasant to learn under you (you are a typical tyrant of a boss from 1950 LOL) they will quit and go somewhere else for the learning experience.

NA,NA,"Trinity College Dublin presents a free weekly public lecture series Understanding Europe’s East which casts a spotlight on parts of our continent which may be less well-known to Irish audiences. The first lecture – on Bulgaria - will take place on Thursday, 22 February. The other six lectures will take place on successive Thursdays to 11 April. The series has been organised by the Department of Russian and Slavonic Studies, Trinity College, Dublin in partnership with the DU Eastern European Society and the DU History Society. This initiative draws on in-house, local and international expertise. Full programme of Understanding Europe’s East: 1. Bulgaria: Pride, Shame and Guile in the Blank Spot of the Balkans (Dimitar Kambourov, Trinity College Dublin) - Thursday, 22 February 6-7 pm, Thomas Davis Theatre 2. Kosovo: Conflict, Peace, and its Ambiguous Future (Gëzim Visoka, Dublin City University) - Thursday, 29 February 6-7 pm, Thomas Davis Theatre 3.Estonia: Identity Narratives in the post-Soviet Era (the 1990s) (Heiko Pääbo, University of Tartu, Johan Skytte Institute of Political Studies, Estonia) - Thursday, 14 March 6-7 pm, Thomas Davis Theatre 4. Romania: Humanitarian aid and care to child refugees during the Cold War (Beatrice Scutaru, Dublin City University) - 21 March 6-7 pm, Thomas Davis Theatre - 5. Transnistria: Re-examining its Origins and Prospects for the Future - (Keith Harrington, Trinity College Dublin) - 28 March 6-7 pm, Thomas Davis Theatre 6. Moldova: Jews and the Politics of Citizenship, 1960-1990 (Irina Nicorici, independent scholar, Chisinau, Moldova) – 4 April 6-7 pm, Thomas Davis Theatre 7. Hungary: Political Leadership Cults from Emperor Franz Joseph to the present day (Balázs Apor, Trinity College Dublin) – 11 April 6-7 pm, Thomas Davis Theatre The series is part-funded by the TCD Faculty Events Fund (FAHSS). Conor Daly of TCD's Department of Russian and Slavonic Studies says about Understanding Europe’s East:  “In this lecture series – through the lens of a less familiar geography (the broader ‘Balkans’, the ‘Baltic Sea Region’) – we explore some of the most important and vital themes in contemporary European culture, history and politics today: the legacy left by the 20th Century Communist experiment on our continent; the shadow left by the Iron Curtain (as well as attempts by some authoritarian leaders to recreate its mirror image today); the phenomenon of the ‘frozen conflict’ (Transnistria); the dilemmas inherent in forging ‘national identity’ and our perceptions of ‘the other’ in a multicultural context; issues of mass migration; the fate of Europe’s minorities; the intersection of secularity and religious culture (Christianity, Judaism, Islam).  ""We are fortunate to have visiting speakers from Chisinau (Moldova) and Tartu (Estonia) – as well as our own ‘local’ experts on Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Kosovo - most of whom were born and grew up in the countries they will be speaking about. In the context of today’s wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, the EU’s re-engagement with the Enlargement process, this is a unique opportunity to understand how Europe’s stakeholders on our easternmost fringe perceive their past as well as their hopes and expectations for the future.” For further information contact Conor Daly at: dalyc27@tcd.ie",0,0,EUR,TCD Department of Russian & Slavonic Studies,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-14T18:00:00Z,2024-03-14T19:00:00Z,Understanding Europe's East: Lecture Series on our Underexplored Regions,"International experts on the history, culture & politics of Bulgaria, Kosovo, Romania, Moldova, Transnistria, Hungary & Baltic Sea Region.",https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/understanding-europes-east-lecture-series-on-our-underexplored-regions-tickets-831042800387,dublin,Sold out

NA,NA,"Congratulations. You found your way here, you beautiful, magical being, you. This is your top secret invitation to the esoteric STUDY HALL for students of astrology. WHAT IS IT? We’ll discuss the current astrology and what it means on a collective and personal level. I’ll show you how to track the transits in your own natal chart and help you with synthesis and interpretation. You will gain insight into the current astrology, your natal astrology, and you’ll learn astrology in the process. There will be opportunity for sharing our stories and we will witness and hold space for one another in our experiences and unfolding. Part circle, part course, we will honour and find rhythm with astrological cycles, while deepening our understanding of astrological archetypes. There is nothing like story for enriching theoretical understanding. There is nothing like embodied experience for developing a direct connection with astrological wisdom. This is astrology in practice: as a method to deepen our engagement with life, and to live with more awareness, intention, and grace. WHO IS IT FOR? This is for students of astrology at all levels of experience. If you are brand new to learning astrology, you’ll receive a prerecorded introduction when you register that will show you how to access your chart and begin to track transits. If you already have some knowledge of the planets, signs, and houses, this circle will help you with synthesis and interpretation. If you are more advanced, you will gain a deeper understanding of the archetypes through real-life examples of how different charts and transits play out. INTENTION My approach to astrology is evolutionary: to emphasize freedom, possibility, choice and evolution: there is no “bad” chart, aspect, or transit. There is always opportunity for learning and evolving. This is a key intention of this offering: to seek interpretations that are helpful, soulful, and that give us options for how we can work with “difficult” transits or energies, as well as the easier ones. REGISTRATION This workshop will be hosted online over zoom. You will receive the zoom link and other event details via email (andi@mysticsandwich.com) after registration . By registering for this event you agree to receive emails from me. You may, of course, opt out at any time. You can register directly here (use code FIRSTSH for 100% off).

A series of seven workshops will be available to join in Kilkenny, Galway, Enniskillen, Dublin, Mullingar, Belfast and Cork between February and March 2024.

Engagement within the sector and between practitioners is essential to the building of this Framework, and to help us articulate the value of archaeological research within the sector and beyond.

NA,NA,"We'd like to welcome you to free meditation classes which take place at the: Monksland Community Centre, Old Tuam Road, Monksland, Athlone on Thursday evenings from 6:00 pm until 7.00 pm. With Sahaja Yoga Meditation we normally sit on chairs to achieve yoga, effortlessly & spontaneously. So there is no need for mats and no special clothing required. All across the globe, many are seeking new sources of energy. Meanwhile, the most transformative energy of all is hiding in plain sight, within us. It's natural, sustainable, and infinitely renewable. It's called inner kundalini energy. And everyone already has it — everyone!. It is often likened to an inner feminine or motherly energy which automatically knows about us and what is needed to help us restore balance and harmony within our subtle being. It works spontaneously, effortlessly, organically and cannot be paid for. Sahaja Yoga Meditation is a simple time-honoured technique that lets you tap into that energy and harness its power to become better balanced and better connected to yourself — emotionally, physically, mentally and spiritually.

About the Lecturer: Horia Mosadiq is an Afghan Woman Human Rights Defender (WHRD) and journalist with more than two decades of experience in human rights, peace, justice and reconciliation, transitional justice, gender, security, and violent extremism in Afghanistan and South Asia.
