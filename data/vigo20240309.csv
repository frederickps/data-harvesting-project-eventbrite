Our ability to use our mind determines how well we can control our external realities. What you may not know is that our Minds have an identity. Creating an Identity of mind allows us to direct our external world intentionally. The language we use to run our lives is one dimensional, which creates needless limitations. Our minds work best in a multidimensional language. Learning how to access your minds resources correctly will enable you to create a life beyond who we desire to be. Our vocabulary, are words we use internally to motivate change, but instead of encouraging us, the imperfections in our speech and articulation restrict access to our minds. There is no synchronicity between the one-dimensional language in our speech and the 4 th dimension of the mind. If you‚Äôre not using the correct language of the mind, the mind disengages where we become confused. We don‚Äôt have the language to describe the life that we want in a way that the mind accepts, understands, and can utilise.

NA,Sold out,NA,"You have a glorious opportunity to get your message into the world. Never before has there been such an exciting time in communication. The ability to transmit your words across the world has existed for decades. What has changed a result of COVID-19 is now people are LISTENING. Virtual communication has now been accepted as the norm. People know that they need to tune into the Facebook Lives and join the Zoom meetings otherwise they are going to be left out of the loop. They are ready to hear your message. Are you ready to give it to them? Your phone and your computer are all you need to make a difference in the world. You have a voice, it‚Äôs time to use it. You have a story, it‚Äôs time to tell it. You have a message, it‚Äôs time to share it. Imagine being able to reach people in places you‚Äôve never heard of and changing the lives of people you have never met. That possibility is more real than ever thanks to virtual speaking. You still aren‚Äôt 100% sure about all this, are you? You‚Äôve done some Facebook Lives, you‚Äôve been in some Zoom meetings and you‚Äôve filmed a few selfie videos. You‚Äôre trying things out, but you‚Äôre not as confident as you‚Äôd like to be. It still feels weird not being able to see people. You still feel self conscious seeing yourself on camera. You aren‚Äôt getting the likes and comments that you see other people getting on their lives and videos. Does it feel like you‚Äôve been left behind by all this change? You haven‚Äôt been left behind yet‚Ä¶but you will if you don‚Äôt act now. When the technology arrived to do virtual speaking, only a tiny fraction of people adopted it. During the 2010s they rose to the top of their fields. The ‚Äúsecond wave‚Äù is now here, and you‚Äôve got to catch it if you want to have a meaningful impact during the 2020s. I joined the second wave late. I started my Youtube channel in 2015, 10 years after Youtube had been created. I first used Zoom in 2018, 5 years after Zoom had been created. I was quicker on the uptake with Facebook Live, being one of the first people in my industry to use it in 2016. I didn‚Äôt have the audience nor the engagement of my peers, but I kept learning the craft. When lockdown hit in 2020, I was able to seamlessly transition my business online. I‚Äôd been preparing for half a decade to speak virtually whilst the competition got caught with their pants down. I managed to grow my audience and increase my income in 2020 when so many businesses struggled or even sadly closed up shop. There‚Äôs one thing that made the difference for me and it will make the difference for you too. I knew how to communicate online. I was far more confident with the tech, more practiced in the communication and more open to the switch to virtual. We still have people who don‚Äôt know how to unmute themselves on Zoom. We still have people who speak like an emotionless robot on their Youtube videos. We still have people who think virtual was just a ‚Äúphase‚Äù and not a transition into a new way of doing things. Don‚Äôt be one of those people. The second wave of virtual communication is here...are you going to jump on it? This is going to be far bigger than the first wave. If you don‚Äôt jump on now, you will get swept away. Equally, if you put in the work now to master virtual speaking, you are going to flourish for the next decade. That is what this Virtual Speaking Masterclass is going to help you do. There are three basic building blocks you need to be a great virtual speaker. Firstly you will learn how to make friends with the camera. Making friends with the camera means that you will: Secondly you will learn why it‚Äôs so important to create an ‚Äúactive window‚Äù. An active window means that you: Thirdly you will learn how to effectively interact with your audience. Strong interaction means that your audience will: Are you ready for the second wave? Then grab your surfboard and sign up for the masterclass! In the true spirit of Virtual Speaking, we will of course be hosting this class virtually so that you can join us from the comfort of your own home. FAQs Is this definitely an online event? Because the event has a physical location? Yes this is entirely online. The physical location allows people in your city (such as you!) to find the event as it shows up as being geographically close to them. Where can I access the masterclass? You can attend the masterclass live on Zoom. You will be sent the link on the day of the masterclass. The event repeats each month, do I need to attend on a monthly basis? No. The same series is repeated every month. You only need to attend one event.",0,0,GBP,David McCrae,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-09T19:00:00Z,2024-03-09T20:30:00Z,Virtual Speaking Masterclass Porto,Online Workshop Teaching You How To Speak Online!,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/virtual-speaking-masterclass-porto-tickets-774999884517,vigo
