1 hour 30 minutes,Refunds up to 7 days before event,"Join us on Wednesday 13 March, as we welcome John Kehoe to CIS for a breakfast conversation. This event will be hosted by our Executive Director, Tom Switzer. The Australian economy has performed better than most economists predicted a year ago. However, probe deeper and things look disturbing. We face not just a productivity drought, but runaway government spending programs that, left unchecked, will lead to budget deficits and stagnation or decline in living standards. Australia, as Treasury‚Äôs Intergenerational Report warned last year, will become older, more indebted, spend big on social services, grow slower, have weaker income growth and tax working-age people more over coming decades. Savings need to be found, but where? Australia is now one of the biggest government spenders on disability in the world, according to the OECD ‚Äì more than double the UK and Canada, and on track to go past the European welfare states of Iceland, Finland and Sweden. The National Disability and Insurance Scheme, which is projected to blow past $100 billion a year, needs to be curtailed. But how? John Kehoe is economics editor of the Australian Financial Review and a former Washington correspondent. Tom Switzer is the Executive Director at the Centre for Independent Studies, and formerly hosted Between the Lines on the ABC‚Äôs Radio National. He is also a regular contributor to The Australian, the Australian Financial Review and Sky News Australia. Can't watch live?

Soul Space Circle is space to connect and share from an open heart with a group of like minded souls. A space to let go of all the stories and any dramas of the day and unwind for a couple of hours or so with presence not pretence. It's a space to open your mind to a new perspective and connect with your soul and the souls of other like-minded beings as we tune into our authenticiy and intuition. We explore a different theme each time. Theme: Being Seen The evening is divided into 3 main parts: 1. Sharing of inspirational self love cards 2. Meditation (in 2 parts: body scan to relax the mind & body followed by a guided meditation intuitively based on the theme) 3. Pairing/connection exercises - asking and responding to questions based on the theme, usually using the benefit of hindsight, and gaining insights through your reflections in others We will consider these types of questions: What does being seen mean to you? How do you prefer to be seen by others and the world? Do you always want to be seen or do you sometimes prefer to stay hidden? Does the way others see you affect the way you see yourself? If you want to be seen for who you are inside how do you portray yourself to others and does it align? If you want to be the change you wish to see in the world how are you allowing yourself to be seen? What if you could choose whether to be seek or not to be seen, visible or invisible, in each moment? What would you choose? There are no right or wrong answers, only what feels true for you in each moment. You can expect to gain greater awareness and insights through the reflections of others and yourself.

NA,No Refunds,"Join Sky Rivers for an immersive shamanic sound bath and Kundalini Activation for energy healing, transformation and spiritual awakening. ÔΩûìÇÄÔΩû What happens during the session? You will lie down on your yoga mat and close your eyes. Sky Rivers, master practitioner of energy medicine, will take you on an immersive shamanic sound journey and Kundalini Activation for energy healing, transformation and spiritual awakening. ÔΩûìÇÄÔΩû What is Kundalini Activation? Kundalini Activation is a powerful energy activation process whereby Sky works on your chakras and energy field to activate Kundalini energy within you. In this process, your chakras are being cleansed and balanced. As you release energetic blockages from your body and energy field, you may experience spontaneous physical movement, tingling or heat in certain areas of your body. You may also experience powerful emotional releases that bring profound cognitive insight and positive change. ÔΩûìÇÄÔΩû What is a Shamanic Sound Bath? Sky Rivers works with music and shamanic sound frequencies to guide you into heightened states of awareness whereby you journey within to receive powerful insights and visions. Combining shamanic sound journeys with Kundalini activation initiates healing on all levels of the energy body, which enhances your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well-being. ÔΩûìÇÄÔΩû The Benefits of Kundalini Activation When Kundalini energy is activated, your body begins to undergo a potent cleansing process where limiting beliefs, suppressed emotions and stuck energy are released from your body and energy field. The negative self-perception that people often hold is replaced with a more positive self-image. Kundalini energy also strengthens the body, enhances productivity, heightens awareness, expands consciousness, sharpens intuition, and ultimately enriches your life, encompassing wealth, health, and relationships. ÔΩûìÇÄÔΩû What Clients say - How Kundalini Activation impacts them & their week ""The past few weeks have opened me up like I could have never imagined; daily life has become a beautiful and blissful experience. This newfound energy that surges through the body pulls me into the moment and opens me up to the immense intensity of experience that was perhaps before overlooked. I feel a sense of unity with others and the environment as I move about my day. I feel so content in daily life."" - Jay Logan ""During my most recent session, I received an influx of divine light unlike anything I have ever felt. It completely changed my energetic vibration - it was as though I was being bathed in divine white light. My clarity, focus, purpose and sense of peace have been amplified as a direct result of this extraordinary energy. It's powerful stuff! Life changing."" - Rachael Cox ""I never felt so connected to my body, mind and soul. I highly recommend Sky for everyone who is seeking answers and awakening for this new world."" - Sth√©fanie Zacharias ""Since my first session, I've experienced more energy, feelings of happiness and everything feeling wonderful. It has helped me to manifest my goals and even relieved pain I have had for a long time in my body."" - Heidi Lude ÔΩûìÇÄÔΩû How often can I join Kundalini Activation? Kundalini Activation with Sky Rivers allows you to activate Kundalini energy within you to transform your body and mind. To achieve a profound transformation with long-term effects, it is recommended to join Kundalini Activation regularly. ÔΩûìÇÄÔΩû About Sky Rivers Sky Rivers has guided many in their Kundalini awakening since 2018, facilitating more than 400 Kundalini Activation events, including weekend immersions and Kundalini facilitator training. As a Kundalini teacher and master practitioner of energy medicine, Sky specialises in energy healing, body-mind transformation and spiritual awakening.

ÔΩûìÇÄÔΩû Video Testimonials ""There is some kind of power that happens in the session. It‚Äôs like you're regaining an aspect of yourself, each time you have one of these experiences. You may not know what it is consciously but the week that follows you‚Äôll start to feel that whatever happened in the session is integrating into your life. I feel more empowered as myself where I feel what I have to say or how I feel is more valued and that it is important and that I can speak up and stand my ground."" - Fenda R. Ashworth ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very happy journey. But your mind is always trying to interfere. That‚Äôs the whole concept of, I think, Kundalini or meditation as well. Just not to pay attention to your mind. I think this was the reason why it didn‚Äôt work the first time. I was too much in my head. I just didn‚Äôt surrender. But once you surrender and just let it go, it‚Äôs amazing.‚Äù ‚Äì Tomek ""I got stuck with transforming my body at one point. So I did some fitness modelling, and I couldn‚Äôt get my body to the level I wanted to, and I was pushing too hard. I was stressing my body, so there was a complete disconnect between my mind and how my body was feeling and healing. I feel like a cloud that‚Äôs been blocking me has been lifted. I think freedom is what I‚Äôve been searching for for so long. So to have that kind of healing has been very transformative."" - Ashley Hudson ‚ÄúIt was right around the time when I was doing the Kundalini Activation in fact that I came to understand that a large component of my posture was a psychosomatic problem. I'm at least about 75% on the way to full posture correction now, you know, after 30 years of trying."" - Philip Haines ‚ÄúWe get stuck in the grind of what we‚Äôre trying to achieve and the way we‚Äôre trying to live our lives. But what Kundalini does is it comes in and strips a lot of those beliefs away. You start to ask yourself questions like ‚ÄòWhy are we here?‚Äô. The feelings of joy and gratitude and whatnot are really quite intense. I think, experiencing those sensations, emotions and feelings really opens you up to everyday life.‚Äù ‚Äì Josh",60,220,AUD,Sky Rivers,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-13T08:00:00Z,2024-03-13T09:30:00Z,Kundalini Activation with Sky Rivers - A Shamanic Sound Healing Journey,"Join Sky Rivers for an immersive shamanic sound bath and Kundalini Activation for energy healing, transformation and spiritual awakening.",https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/kundalini-activation-with-sky-rivers-a-shamanic-sound-healing-journey-tickets-785705926577,sydney,Sold out

Inclusivity: Classes are broadly inclusive and welcoming to people across Multi- Generational/Ability/Experience/Familiarity - Backgrounds and Levels. For example, classes may include Adults, Seniors, Children. Children must be accompanied by an adult that is present at all times, with Children and Adult both booked and both participating at their own pace during the class. The level of participation one chooses is optional to cater for one's own individual needs, including practicing only when one considers it to be suitable and safe to do so under one's own current circumstances and conditions. For example, at times some attendees may be recovering from an injury or past illness or may be experiencing longer-term conditions. Some attendees may choose to engage in only the very gentlest of practices and may for example elect to rest in a deeply relaxed position for some of the time. Others attendees may elect to practice much more strongly or dynamically or energetically where suitable and safe to do. In attending you are agreeing to be fully responsible for your own safe practice including following any professional medical advice you have received related to exercising only in the manner prescribed and only where suitable. At times, some or all of the practices may be unsuitable. Learning Yoga practices can at times require some patience and a willingness to begin to slow down. Practice is supported by listening carefully to guidelines and instructions and to your own body. Attending several classes will support a more gradual progression of understanding and development at a more relaxed pace and is a more likely path towards meaningful wellbeing and health benefits.

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

NA,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

NA,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

Your business competitors are not only working on stealing your customers away from you, they are also working on stealing your best employees from you. You are competing against other employers to attract and keep high quality employees. And your best employees?

They are hungry for knowledge, for wisdom, they want what's in your head, and they want you to make their learning experience inspirational not painful.

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

NA,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

This can be difficult as puppies that haven't been fully vaccinated should not be socialised outdoors with other dogs. That‚Äôs where Puppy Parties comes in! It‚Äôs as cool as it sounds, and it's a great way to safely introduce your young, unvaccinated pup to a variety of dog breeds of different sizes, and to new smells, sounds, people, etc. We start the party by playing everyone‚Äôs favourite, ‚ÄòPass the Puppy‚Äô where we pass everyone‚Äôs puppies around in a circle to get them used to being held by other people (and gives the hoomans a chance to cuddle other pups too). If it‚Äôs your first time owning a dog or it‚Äôs been some time since your last one, then you might also have a few questions you'd like answered. The staff would be more than happy to answer any questions you might have about: Training ‚Äì toilet training and play biting Worming and flea treatment Desexing ‚Äì when and why General Puppy Care ‚Äì how to do a health check at home Insurance ‚Äì why and what to look out for It‚Äôs a very relaxed environment where you can have a glass of wine, some beer, or soft drinks and chat with the other owners and swap quirky stories about your new furbaby.

You don't need to be a member/client of the Southern Cross Vet family to come along! If your puppy is unwell, please refrain from attending, and call the clinic on (02) 9516 0234 to cancel your ticket.

Your business competitors are not only working on stealing your customers away from you, they are also working on stealing your best employees from you. You are competing against other employers to attract and keep high quality employees. And your best employees? In this knowledge based economy, best employees know the key to their own long term well-being is their own skill set. They are hungry for knowledge, for wisdom, they want what's in your head, and they want you to make their learning experience inspirational not painful. If you refuse to teach them, if you are not effective at coaching, or if it's unpleasant to learn under you (you are a typical tyrant of a boss from 1950 LOL) they will quit and go somewhere else for the learning experience.

NA,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

1 hour,NA,"Dementia Journey: A Carer‚Äôs Guide to Dementia, is an unvarnished view, on the challenging Dementia Journey of two untrained carers and how they faced and managed the disease, as the illness evolved through each of the different stages! Blanche and Jennifer draw on their own personal experiences and intent to help readers and carers understand the Dementia Journey, and to lessen the stress and emotional toll, by their lived experiences! Some of the points that Blanche and Jennifer will discuss : About Blanche Antonisen Blanche Antonisen was born in Goa, a Portuguese colony until 1968, situated on the southwestern coast of India. She moved from Goa to start her school as a boarder in Karachi, Pakistan. Blanche was a boarder from age 5 to 18 at a Catholic school run by the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary until she finished school. In 1971 when the India/Pakistan war started, she had to leave Pakistan. With a Portuguese passport and unable to stay in Pakistan, a nun who had taught her now lived in Australia and recognised her refugee status and stepped in. Blanche became an Australian citizen in 1973. She married Jack Antonisen, a Dutchman she met whilst travelling. They have two daughters and four grandchildren. Blanche completed her tertiary education as an adult in Australia, gaining her Bachelor of Arts in Communication from the University of Western Sydney. A proud stay-at-home mother for 20 years, when her children were at senior school, Blanche gained employment in public relations, technical writing, and administration. She has been an active member of the community, volunteering at schools and helping people in her local community and neighbourhood. After 46 years together, with his Dementia diagnosis, Jack changed and became a stranger and Blanche took on the role of a carer 24/7. After Jack died, Blanche spent 18 months overseas, learning creative writing in New York, and renting an apartment in London to get to know her English grandkids and travel around Europe. Blanche enjoys reading, belongs to a book club, appreciates the arts, takes nature and healthy cooking seriously, and her regular travels have enhanced her cultural sensitivity, to adopt and adapt to globalisation and its benefits. About Jennifer Muir Jennifer Muir OAM was born in Melbourne and attended school and university in Sydney. Jennifer travelled widely and lived in England and America where she met and later married her husband Fulton. On returning to Australia in 1981, she became a library teacher in Canberra for 15 years. She has always been committed to community service. After retiring she spent ten years as the President of a volunteer program working with primary school children, as well as balancing her commitments for a time as the National President of the Australian Women of the Year Association. When she returned to live in Canberra she and her family lived on a farm. She thoroughly enjoyed the rural life but left to move into the leafy Canberra suburbs to be closer to her family and doctors when Fulton was diagnosed with Dementia. For two years, Jennifer cared for him in their family home prior to him moving into a nursing home, where he died a few months later. She was married to Fulton for 40 years before he passed away from Dementia in 2013. She has four children and three stepchildren. Jennifer enjoys being a proud grandmother of five. Her main interests at present include studying Latin, reading, movies and music. Jennifer has a keen sense of humour which helped her through the Dementia journey. Free event with registration.

1 hour,NA,"The inside story of the global megachurch and its charismatic leader, Brian Houston. In 2023 the curtain finally came down on Brian Houston. The rock star of Pentecostalism, former Global Senior Pastor of Hillsong Church, was acquitted of concealing his father's sexual abuse of a minor, but it was too late. His glittering megachurch had disowned him. How had it come to this? And how did Hillsong, the brightest star of international evangelical Christianity, fall to earth so spectacularly? Following in his father Frank's footsteps, Brian led Hillsong to become the nation's biggest and loudest Pentecostal church, built on the millions donated by its followers. He would hold audiences of 20,000 in the palm of his hand with a powerful message from God: You need more money. Houston took his church worldwide, and even made it into the White House. Justin Bieber and several Kardashians were Hillsong regulars. Politicians courted Hillsong, with its magnetic appeal to aspirational Australians, and the church's story became entwined with that of Australia's first Pentecostal prime minister, Scott Morrison, who looked to Brian Houston as a key spiritual influence. But just as Houston's kingdom was at the very height of its powers, it dramatically fell apart when the church's dirty secrets came tumbling out. Behind the scenes a secret insurrection, led by young Christian women, had mobilised. Journalist David Hardaker had been investigating the Hillsong phenomenon for several years, gaining unparalleled access to former insiders, when he received a tip-off. Something big was going down About the author David Hardaker is an experienced Walkley Award-winning investigative journalist who has worked for Four Corners, 7.30, Foreign Correspondent and 60 Minutes.

1 hour 30 minutes,NA,"The ‚Äònon-identity problem‚Äô has profoundly influenced the ways in which philosophers think about harm in reproductive ethics. Suppose, for example, that a woman is undergoing treatment for syphilis. If she becomes pregnant now, rather than waiting until she is cured, the child will suffer from congenital syphilis. Derek Parfit suggests that our intuition that the child is harmed if the woman fails to wait, is false. If she waits, she will have a different child: one conceived with different gametes. Parfit‚Äôs point has been taken by many commentators, to indicate a specifically genetic account of identity. But with increased understanding of epigenetics, it is not so clear that genetic identity is fixed from conception. A variety of environmental factors determine whether specific genes are silenced, or active before conception and after, and to what degree. This process - epigenetics - calls into question the relationship between genes and identity. Accordingly, the distinction between harmful and identity-changing genetic interventions becomes difficult to sustain. In this paper, I will explore several approaches to understanding the relationship between genes, harm and identity, in ways that preserve our fundamental intuitions. Ultimately, I conclude that it is not possible to sustain both a genetic understanding of identity, and a belief that some genetic interventions are harmful (or therapeutic) and others identity-changing, whether in the conception phase or afterwards.",0,0,AUD,The University of Sydney,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-13T04:30:00Z,2024-03-13T06:00:00Z,Epigenetics and the non-identity problem |  Anna Smajdor (Oslo),A Discipline of Philosophy seminar at the University of Sydney,https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/epigenetics-and-the-non-identity-problem-anna-smajdor-oslo-tickets-856655448507,sydney,NA

About  Anthony Van Lam As a watercolourist, I strive to create beautiful organic shapes representing healing and wellness through an exploration of lines, silhouettes, and colour. I also create with mixed media and use the beauty of shapes, flowers, and animals as multiple transparent layers in a composition, blended to generate deeper meanings.  I m a strong believer in using what you have and what you have learnt, and putting it into practice. I like to use my imagination to create beautiful things. My artworks are all related to everything in life that fascinates me and always overwhelmed me with excitement. I need their stories to be told through my art. Some of my subjects are darker but I like to share the different sides of them. Especially the beauty of the lessons in life, sacrifices, inner strengths and beliefs, all these topics are very important for me to share.

1 hour,NA,"Join us for an engaging session that delves into the complexities of software-based communication systems and explores innovative solutions to ensure reliability and predictability. We are thrilled to have Prof.Dr.-Ing. Klaus Wehrle, a distinguished Professor in the field as our esteemed speaker. üìÖ Date: Wednesday 13th March 2024 üïí Time: 2.00pm-3.00pm üìç Location: UNSW Kensington - School of Computer Science and Engineering, Building K17, Level 1, Seminar Room 113, and online Title : Reliable and Predictable Software-based Communication Systems Abstract : The softwarization of networks provides a new degree of flexibility in network architectures and operation. But its software components can result in erratic system and network behaviour and unexpected runtime performance.This challenges the development and deployment of flexible software functions, so-called Network Functions (NF), in performance-critical networks, such as the Internet core or industrial networks.To address these challenges, we propose and adapt Symbolic Execution as a rigorous and effective methodology enabling a qualitative and quantitative analysis of software running in critical network elements -- before deployment.The talk shows how symbolic analysis methods can be applied on networked systems, how the computational challenges can be tackled and that very insidious bugs can be discovered in widely used software. Bio : Klaus Wehrle is Professor of Computer Science and Head of the Communication and Distributed Systems Group at RWTH Aachen University,He received his diploma (1999) and his doctorate (Dr.-Ing., 2002) from the University of Karlsruhe. In 2002 and 2003, Klaus was a postdoctoral fellow at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California at Berkeley (UCB). In 2004, he established a junior research group on protocol engineering and distributed systems at the University of T√ºbingen supported by a DFG early career award. In 2006 he joined RWTH Aachen University as an associate professor, since 2010 as a full professor; from 2019 to 2022 as acting dean of the Department of Computer Science.

NA,NA,"The Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide will conduct its final public hearing at the InterContinental Sydney, 117 Macquarie Street, from Monday 4 March to Thursday 28 March 2024. Anyone wishing to attend the public hearing can pre-register via Eventbrite. Please note that the witness list for Hearing Block 12 has already been finalised and registering to attend the hearing means you wish to attend as a member of the audience. The Royal Commission has identified all witnesses to be called at this Hearing Block.  Senior Government Ministers, military chiefs and Departmental heads will be called to give evidence at the Royal Commission‚Äôs final public hearing. Full witness lists will be released closer to the event. The Royal Commission‚Äôs inquiries have been guided by the deeply personal and often harrowing experiences shared by serving and ex-serving ADF members, and their families, in submissions and private sessions, which have shone a bright light on the cultural, systemic and structural issues contributing to the suicide crisis within the Defence and veteran community.  Public hearings are a critical evidence gathering tool and the Royal Commission must use the limited time available to call witnesses whose stories and information speak directly to key issues and themes where there might be evidence or knowledge gaps it‚Äôs seeking to address.   This is particularly so with our final public hearing, which will be of significance to our final report and recommendations.   The Royal Commission acknowledges there will be some in the community who are disappointed not to be called as a lived experience witness at its upcoming hearing; however, Commissioners and staff want to sincerely thank everyone who has shared their experience with us for the significant contribution they have made to this inquiry.  We are incredibly grateful for your courage and strength in coming forward and hope that by knowing the important role you‚Äôve played in this inquiry that you feel heard. The Royal Commission expects some days to reach seating capacity. As such, members of the public are encouraged to register in advance for each day they wish to attend the hearing.  The hearing schedule may change without notice. Daily start and finish times are approximate and will be confirmed closer to the event. Please visit the Royal Commission's website for regular updates. For those unable to attend in person, the proceedings will be livestreamed on the Royal Commission's website. Please be aware that these hearings might contain material and images that are distressing for some people. The nature of the hearings also means that there might be people in military uniforms, as well as military service providers, present. For further updates from the Royal Commission, you can subscribe to our monthly newsletter or follow us on Facebook and Twitter. Prior to entering the hearing room you will be required to submit to security screening, including bag checks.

NA,NA,"Overcome public speaking fear with gradual exposure, in a supportive environment. Observe a free trial to see if it's right for you. Based out of New York City for 30 years, we are now offering these classes online to an international audience.  This one free trial class is an observation session to see if the US$425/10 session program is right for you. The instructor will be happy to answer any questions following the session. ****30 Years of Testimonials: https://www.speakeeezi.com/success.htm Zenspeak Public Speaking Center: https://www.speakeeezi.com Once the 10 session package is purchased, the student may use their sessions however they choose.  The course is ongoing, so each session has participants at all levels. We use a workbook which each student works through at their own pace. This is the 30th year we‚Äôve been helping people turn their dread into confidence. Gradual exposure allows you to face fear in manageable steps, at your own pace, in a supportive environment. Instructors Charles di Cagno and Kyra Smith, are phobia therapists, and former and current Directors of Public Speaking at White Plains Hospital Anxiety Treatment Center in the United States.  Whatever the level of public speaking, we can help you improve. For those with anxiety, we provide gradual exposure to public speaking through a step ladder of basic to more advanced exercises. For the more experienced, it's a platform tailored to your specific needs to improve various delivery techniques. It is self-paced, in a low pressure, supportive environment with lots of feedback to address your specific issues. Begin with basic exercises and move forward only when ready.  The course is ongoing, with a mix of beginning and advanced students. Our hope is you are inspired, not intimidated by the dynamic speakers present, and keep in mind they started with the same fears, progressing to their present level by consistent effort. The course is not difficult. If you have the will, we offer the way to turn a liability into your most powerful asset. The real challenge is admitting you need guidance, getting started, and making a committed, consistent effort. Our 100% success rate over 20 years for wedding speeches is just one indication of our effectiveness. But, whatever the challenge, (formal presentation, group discussion, business meeting, sales, confrontation, employment interview) the program is customized to fit your needs. Sample Gradual Exposure Program Outline for Public Speaking Anxiety: Session One - Get comfortable hearing your voice in public by responding to very simple questions while seated. The questions (i.e., name, occupation, where you live, etc.) require little thought or content. Session Two - Learning to stand confidently before a group. You will stand, with several others and respond to simple questions. As your confidence increases, one by one, each person standing will sit, until you are standing alone. You will continue until this begins to feel comfortable. Session Three- This exercise is the same as the previous one except you start by standing alone. Session Four - Gestures and Movement. Enhance your message, decrease tension and project a confident demeanor incorporating non-verbal skills. Session Five - Implement the skills learned in the session four by relating a personal experience using gestures and movement to enhance your narrative. Session Six - Respond to Questions. Open the floor to questions on a topic of choice. Session Seven - Impromptu Speaking. Learn to organize and deliver an unprepared (no notes) talk. Session Eight - Prepared Speech (Instructor Guided). Learn the secret of outlining and presenting a prepared speech with minimal effort or stress. Session Nine - Prepared Speech. Outline and deliver a speech unassisted. Once you have mastered the above you can begin simulating all manner of interpersonal and public communication including: Persuasive Speaking Panel Discussion Conflict Resolution Defending your Position Debating Initiating and Sustaining Conversation As well as many others We look forward to working with you.",0,0,USD,k smith,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-11T22:00:00Z,2024-03-11T23:30:00Z,Conquer Your Fear of Public Speaking - Sydney- Virtual Free Trial Class,"Overcome public speaking fear with gradual exposure, in a supportive environment.

NA,NA,"Join us for these special lectures to celebrate the International Day of Mathematics at UNSW. Including audience Q&A with the speakers, and a networking reception following the talks with finger food and refreshments. Puzzles and patterns in the primes - Christian Bagshaw For thousands of years, mathematicians have been fascinated by prime numbers. As far as our records indicate, it was Euclid who first provided a proof that there are infinitely many primes. This curiosity has continued into the modern age, leading to more nuanced questions. Are there infinitely many primes that end with the digit 7? What about pairs of primes that differ by two - how many of those are there? Can every even number be written as the sum of two primes? This talk will touch on some of these fascinating problems and provide a glimpse into what a number theory PhD student works on all day. Random networks, random walks & other stories - Professor Catherine Greenhill We live in a world filled with large, complex networks, such as social networks, contact networks or transport networks. A network consists some objects (e.g. people, cities) and the relationships between them (e.g. friendship, train lines). Researchers who study a particular real-world network often want to compare their network to a family of networks that share similar properties. We can do this using random networks, where the connections are chosen randomly in some way. I will talk about some of my research on random networks, and the (random?) choices that led me here. Christian Bagshaw is a PhD student in Pure Mathematics at UNSW. He earned a BSc (first-class honours) in Pure Mathematics from the University of Calgary, where he received multiple university medals upon graduation. His research is focused in an area of mathematics called number theory, which studies (among other things) the properties of prime numbers. Christian has won several awards for his presentations, such as the Best Student Talk at NTDU 2022 and the Most Outstanding Talk in Pure Mathematics at the 2023 UNSW Mathematics and Statistics Postgraduate Conference. He also earned an Honourable Mention for the B.H Neumann Prize for the Best Student Talk at AustMS 2022. Catherine Greenhill started her academic career as an undergraduate at the University of Queensland, before obtaining her doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1992. She held research positions at the University of Leeds and at the University of Melbourne, then joined UNSW in 2002. Today she is a Professor and head of the Combinatorics group in the School of Mathematics and Statistics, UNSW Sydney. Catherine's research involves discrete mathematics, theoretical computer science and probability. She was elected as a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 2022. 6:00-6:30pm: Christian Bagshaw 6:30-7:00pm: Catherine Greenhill 7:00-8:00pm: Networking reception The lectures will be presented in Room 4082/4083 on level 4 of the Anita B.

NA,NA,"City of Ryde Libraries in partnership with City of Ryde Community Services are inviting you to empower yourself by learning how you can Boost Your Brain with a leading authority of improving brain function, Dr Helena Popovic at Ryde Library this Seniors Festival. She will be sharing tips and advice from her latest book, Can Adventure Prevent Dementia? A Guide to Outwitting Alzheimer‚Äôs. Most people work on building up and boosting their financial assets. But how many people work on building up and boosting their greatest asset: their brain? The revolutionary field of neuroplasticity has shown that we can change the very structure and function of our brain. We can grow new brain cells, new circuits and new connections in response to what we do, how we think and the way we respond to daily demands. We are much more than passive victims of our genes, our past or our circumstances: we play an active role in how our brains develop throughout our lives. However, most people are yet to realise the enormous personal power this gives them. When we discover how to boost our brain, we can boost our performance and productivity in every area of life. For the brain to stay healthy and operate at its best, we need the right stimulation, motivation, nutrition and recovery. Most importantly, we need to take charge of our thinking because our thoughts play an integral role in wiring our brains for long term success. Dr Helena‚Äôs high energy, engaging talk will provide immediately implementable, practical suggestions to boost your brain and enable you to achieve more than you thought possible. Discover how to: 1. sharpen thinking and creativity 2. improve concentration and memory and tap into brain potential you never knew you had 3. increase capacity for learning and problem solving 4. reduce your risk of depression, anxiety disorders and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease 5. prevent the mental decline we‚Äôve mistakenly believed was inevitable with ageing Dr Helena Popovic MMBS is one of the world‚Äôs leading authorities on improving brain function. She draws on three decades of personal and professional experience to offer a step-by-step guide to enhancing our brain to achieve our goals and to prevent Alzheimer‚Äôs. PLEASE NOTE: City of Ryde Libraries events will be moving to a different booking platform and will no longer be using Eventbrite. Events can be found at: www.ryde.nsw.gov.au/libraryevents, to stay up to date with What's On at the library sign up to our free monthly eNewsletter here. About the Author Dr Helena Popovic MBBS is a medical doctor and international speaker who shows people how to boost their brain at any age or stage of life so they can: perform at their peak throughout their career, eliminate brain fog in menopause, avoid Alzheimer‚Äôs and other dementias in retirement. She also provides a roadmap for living longer, stronger, healthier and happier. Dr Helena graduated from the University of Sydney and has spent over 30 years researching the brain and teaching people how to reach their full potential. Discovering how to boost our brain is the single most important investment we can make to achieve our goals, solve complex problems and create a fulfilling life. Dr Helena‚Äôs philosophy is that education is more powerful than medication and she believes in growing bolder rather than older. She is the author of three best-selling books: 1. In Search of My Father is a guide to caring for someone with dementia. 2. Can Adventure Prevent Dementia? shows how we can all build a better brain. 3. NeuroSlimming - Let Your Brain Change Your Body reveals how to shed excess body fat without dieting or deprivation.

Organizations are critically dependent on information technology (IT) to better support their business goals. Risk management plays a critical role in protecting an organization‚Äôs information assets, and its mission therein, from IT-related risk. An effective risk management process is an important component of a successful IT security program. The principal goal of an organization‚Äôs risk management process should be to protect the organization and its ability to perform their mission, not just its IT assets. Therefore, the risk management process should not be treated primarily as a technical function carried out by the IT experts who operate and manage the IT system, but as an essential management function of the organization. Risk is the net negative impact of the exercise of a vulnerability, considering both the probability and the impact of occurrence. Risk management is the process of identifying risk, assessing risk, and taking steps to reduce risk to an acceptable level. This course provides an overview into the specific criteria, steps and actions necessary to implement and sustain a comprehensive Information Risk Management program.
