You will also develop many of the skills and techniques that will help you to use the structure effectively. Course Contents: The selection of new employees can be a long drawn out and expensive process. This means that we must do everything we can to ensure that when we do make a decision we choose the right person. Having gone through all the trouble of working through a selection process there is nothing worse than taking on a new employee who turns out to be unsuitable. A robust selection process will minimize the risk of this happening and, of course, effective interviewing needs to be part of that. If you handle selection interviewing in a logical, structured, and professional way the risk of choosing the wrong person is much smaller. This interview skills training concentrates on developing interview techniques. Although we will briefly touch on the laws of discrimination a detailed discussion of it is outside of the scope of this program. Similarly, the topics of Diversity and Equality of Opportunity will only be covered briefly. We concentrate on competency-based interviewing skills in this training. This is sometimes described as behavioral, situational, or job-related interviewing. Course Topics: Similar Circles – This icebreaker requires some listening and questioning and therefore provides a very relevant start to the training. The Selection Interview – We explain what a selection interview is with particular reference to competency-based interviewing. The learners then participate in an activity to identify the benefits and drawbacks of this approach before looking at ways to overcome those drawbacks. Diversity and Equality of Opportunity – In this brief look at the topic Yare reminded of the importance of treating job candidates fairly. The PRICE structure – Learners are introduced to our PRICE structure. PRICE organization – In this activity learners consider 37 action cards that describe behaviors and techniques that may be used by interviewers. Their task is to fit these cards within the context of the PRICE structure. This will help them to develop a good understanding of PRICE and how they may be able to use it. Wrinkle Chaser – You conduct a short interview activity to demonstrate the difficulty of interviewing without adequate preparation. The Selection Process – Learners are reminded that interviews are a part of a selection process and do not normally stand alone Question Plans – Preparing a question plan is identified as key to good preparation. Participants are encouraged to use a structured approach supported by our Question Plan template. First Impressions – Learners take part in activities to help them consider both the importance of making the right first impressions on candidates and the danger that interviewers can be unduly influenced by their first impressions of interviewees. We also look at rapport building at the start of the interview. Traffic Lights – In this activity learners consider nine different question types and decide whether they should be used in interviews. Effective Listening – Learners identify barriers to effective listening and ways to overcome those barriers. The Close Phase – This provides advice on what to cover with the candidate at the end of the interview. The Evaluation Phase – Learners are encouraged to suspend judgment until the interview is over. They are then taken through an approach for evaluating and scoring the interview linked to their question plan. Interview Practice – Learners take part in two or three interview simulations. They act as interviewer once and then as an interviewee and/or observer. Each of these roles gives them a different perspective on interviewing and will help them to apply the principles covered in this program when they conduct real selection interviews in the workplace.

In this course, you will learn to: make better decisions, be more creative and innovative, manage conflict and work with difficult group members, negotiate for preferred outcomes, improve group communication in virtual environments, develop a better overall understanding of human interaction, and work more effectively as a team. Our goal is to help you understand these important dynamics of group communication and learn how to put them into practice to improve your overall teamwork. Course Contents: Module 1 Module 1 is all about communication. But not the common sense or taken-for-granted notions of communication you might expect. Instead, we’re going to rethink communication and challenge some of the conventional wisdom about communication that is common in our society. We’ll compare and contrast different theories or models of communication, and see if we can develop a more sophisticated understanding of communication to understand the complexities of human interaction in today’s groups. We’ll also explore some of the hidden forces of group communication, like context, systems and institutions, and design. These are all things that are “present” in any group situation, influencing how we interact with each other, but easy to miss if we’re not looking. We want to expand our field of vision, so to speak, so we have a fuller understanding of what’s happening in any group situation. Module 2 Module 2 focuses on group development and decision-making. We’ll look at how groups come together through socialization, how they develop norms, and how roles emerge. And we’ll compare and contrast different models that explain these processes. We’ll examine the various decision-making traps that groups can fall into, while also developing better practices for making good group decisions. And we’ll explore how groups can be more creative and innovative in their decision-making. Module 3 Module 3 is all about conflict, difference, and diversity. We’ll learn how groups can have a good fight and how you can choose the right words in a dispute…as well as how to negotiate with others when things get difficult. We’ll also explore why difference and diversity are so important for group communication, and how understanding the concept of identity is critical for our involvement in groups. And we’ll pay special attention to communication and gender, one of the most significant aspects of difference and diversity for groups to understand. Module 4 Module 4 covers group communication and technology…an increasingly prevalent aspect of the modern landscape of group work we must understand. We’ll look at the concept of virtual work and how groups are using technology, as well as various models and theories of media functionality and information processing. We’ll cover several practical and conceptual issues we should always keep in mind when it comes to technology and group communication, and we’ll explore some cutting-edge thinking about technology and group work through the fascinating theory of sociomateriality.

To be successful, every organisation needs good managers. Manager Management  Training: With this course, you will be able to provide the skills, guidance, and empowerment to your team of managers.

The application of these techniques will be presented as part of an overall framework, as you identify key deliverables and the major steps from modeling and analysis of the current state and future state design. Course Outline: Develop the Process List Every workplace contains business processes, however not all business processes are documented. This section focuses on how to develop a process list. After identifying the business processes, decision-making tools are practiced to consider what is important to the business. These tools include using prioritization and weighting criteria to make decisions based on business needs. Finally, you will discover how to gain support and buy-in from key stakeholders. Define the Scope Identifying the scope of the business process is critical for defining the boundaries of the project. In this section you will learn how to identify and document the boundaries of the business process that needs to be improved. Discussion and consideration of overcoming scope creep problems is also reviewed regarding the business process. Finally, you will determine what approvals are necessary before moving into a detailed business analysis. Draw the Process Model Process modeling ensures an understanding of the business processes being analyzed. In this section, you will learn the basics of process models, standard charting shapes, and the various levels used to draw business processes. Both visual models and text are practiced in this section to ensure an understanding of the current state, as well as review who needs to be involved in this step. Estimate Time and Cost Estimating time and cost for the current state involves analyzing process and cycle time, as well as existing costs to provide a return on investment. Examination of how to determine time and cost estimates for the current state is provided in this section, as well as the specific types of costs to analyze for potential business process improvement. Validate the Process Model Reviewing and confirming your analysis of the current state is critical before identifying potential improvements for the desired future state. This section focuses on the correct sequence to perform the validation steps with the project stakeholders. After validation is completed, improvement targets can begin to be identified. Apply Improvement Methods Now that the current state has been validated, the course focus begins to shift toward the future state. This section includes applying multiple techniques for proposing changes to the future state by using an extreme visual model. A process is followed to apply six improvement methods to ensure effective analysis work has been applied. Upon completion of analyzing what to improve, you will draw the process model for the proposed future state. Establish Controls & Metrics Adding controls to the business process ensures accuracy, reliability and can reduce errors. In this first part of the section, you will identify controls necessary for the future state. Establishing metrics helps ensure effectiveness, efficiency and adaptability of the business process. The second part of this section will help you distinguish which metrics will help evaluate whether the improved business process will work as you planned. Test the Process Testing the new or improved business process helps to identify bottlenecks, as well as work out bugs, defects and/or errors. Testing also helps ensure the process meets stated goals and provides for smooth implementation of the business process. This section will help you identify what needs to be included in testing the proposed future state. Evaluate Change Readiness During the analysis process it is critical to consider what the business is trying to accomplish. Evaluating change readiness helps to create strategies for minimizing the change impacts on the workplace, the workers, as well as avoiding distractions. This section examines change impacts, resistors to change and how to create an implementation plan for the changes identified to the business process. Perform Continuous Improvement Continuous improvement is an ongoing effort to enhance products, services or processes. This section focuses on how to monitor a business process and make adjustments as necessary so the business process repeatedly gets better over time. You will learn how to use different root cause analysis techniques to improve business processes and how to put together a continuous improvement plan. Finally, you will monitor data to identify and rank performance problems once the business process has been piloted.

The primary reason for this is the need for consistent delivery of high priority requests. Scrum is the most widespread practice in Agile project management. This methodology uses short time-boxes (work confined in regular, repeatable work cycles) like a sprint (or iteration) in Scrum to allow customers to have a tangible and objective view of a product’s progress. This way of working is becoming increasingly popular and is being used in other areas. The EXIN Agile Scrum Foundation is a certification provided by the EXIN certification and accreditation body that validates a professional’s blended knowledge in Agile methodologies and Scrum practices. In this course the benefits and practices of Agile frameworks in general and Scrum in particular will be explored. Topics include working together successfully with Agile to achieve the objectives set by the customer. The course covers the Scrum practices regarding cross-functional and self-managed teams, producing a working deliverable at the end of each iteration or sprint. Target Audience: Primary Secondary Learning Objectives: At the end of the course, you will have demonstrated an understanding of: Benefits of Taking This Course: Learners will be able to apply the following in practice: Customer satisfaction: Agile Scrum facilitates changing customer requirements. The flexible way of working allows for changing demands and new features. Changes can easily be facilitated, without disrupting the project flow or affecting the team’s morale. Transparency: one of the Agile Scrum principles is active ‘user’ and/or product owner involvement. The progress, status, changes are all visible so that it is clear at all times what the end product will be like. This way, expectations are effectively managed. High Quality & Low Risk: testing is integrated throughout the project so that any quality issues can be detected and addressed at an early stage. The Sprints are followed by a review which allows the team to reflect on the previous sprint and discuss improvements for the next. This allows for adjustments according to the client’s wishes.

स्वास्थ्य और कल्याण में नए अवसर खोलना। छह सप्ताह के कोर्स में, प्रतिभागियों को कंप्यूटर की मौलिक संचालन, इंटरनेट नेविगेशन, ईमेल संचार, और भाषाओं के बीच अनुवाद के लिए चैटजीपीटी का उपयोग करने जैसे आवश्यक आईटी कौशल सीखने को मिलेगा। पाठ्यक्रम में ऑनलाइन सुरक्षा, सोशल मीडिया बुनियादी बातों, डिजिटल बैंकिंग, और नौकरी खोजने की रणनीतियों को भी शामिल किया गया है। यह परियोजना मॉड्यूलर है, जिससे प्रतिभागी किसी भी चरण में शामिल हो सकते हैं, सभी समुदाय के सदस्यों के लिए लचीलापन और समावेशिता सुनिश्चित करते हैं। इसके अलावा, हमारे सामुदायिक कैफे में मुफ्त चाय, कॉफी, और केक की पेशकश की जाएगी, प्रतिभागियों को जोड़ने और आराम करने के लिए एक आमंत्रण स्थल प्रदान करते हुए। कैफे दोपहर 2 बजे तक खुला रहेगा, प्रतिभागियों को एक दूसरे से मिलने और जो सीखा गया है उस पर चर्चा करने का उत्तम अवसर प्रदान करते हुए। आजको तीव्रगतिमा अगाडि बढिरहेको संसारमा, डिजिटल साक्षरता केवल एक सम्पत्ति मात्र होइन, एक आवश्यकता पनि हो। यस महत्त्वपूर्ण आवश्यकतालाई चिन्दै, डाइवर्स कम्युनिटी डिजिटली इन्क्लूसिभ परियोजनाले

पृष्ठभूमिका व्यक्तिहरूलाई लक्षित गर्दछ। इसको मिशन दैनिक जीवनमा प्रविधिको प्रयोगलाई सजिलो बनाउने, सार्वजनिक सेवाहरूमा राम्रो पहुँच प्रदान गर्ने, र रोजगारी, सामाजिक सुरक्षा, स्वास्थ्य र कल्याणमा नयाँ अवसरहरू खोल्ने हो। छ हप्ताको कोर्समा, सहभागीहरूले कम्प्युटरका मौलिक सञ्चालनदेखि इन्टरनेट नेभिगेशन, ईमेल संचार, र भाषाहरू बीच अनुवाद गर्न च्याटजीपीटी प्रयोग गर्ने जस्ता आवश्यक आईटी कौशलहरू सिक्नेछन्। पाठ्यक्रममा अनलाइन सुरक्षा, सामाजिक सञ्जालका आधारभूत ज्ञान, डिजिटल बैंकिङ, र रोजगारी खोजीका रणनीतिहरू पनि समावेश गरिएको छ। यो परियोजना मोड्युलर डिजाइनमा तयार गरिएको छ, जसले कुनै पनि चरणमा सहभागीहरूले सहभागिता जनाउन सक्ने गरी लचिलो र समावेशी बनाइएको छ। थपतः, हाम्रो सामुदायिक क्याफेले निःशुल्क चिया, कफी, र केक प्रदान गर्ने छ, जसले सहभागीहरूलाई जोड्ने र विश्राम गर्ने एक स्वागत योग्य स्थान प्रदान गर्दछ। क्याफे दिउँसो २ बजेसम्म खुला रहनेछ, सहभागीहरूलाई एक अर्कासँग भेट्ने र सिकेका कुराहरूमा चर्चा गर्ने उत्तम अवसर प्रदान गर्दै।",0,0,GBP,Digital Skills

Each artist explores the poetic arrangement of making through their various painting, drawing, collage and performance practices, which come together here to probe themes of perspective, vantage points and concealment. With sensitive observations of subject alongside a playful and charged handling of material and surface, the thirteen artists present their own sites for viewers to peer into. The motif of a window punctuates the show through elements of overlaid transparency, inner and outer landscapes and a framing of negative space. Layering, inverting, marking, enveloping its subject, ‘Arranging a Window’ explores the potency of the artist’s hand as an instrument for initiating new ways of seeing. It invites viewers to delve into these obscured windows and occupy the spaces they form.

1 hour 30 minutes,Mobile eTicket,NA,"About this event D.19.2.31 contains a reply to a question of law which is attributed in Justinian’s Digest to the late-Republican jurist P. Alfenus Varus. At the beginning of the text, we are told that several people had delivered grain under contract to a certain Saufeius which was shot into common pile in the hold of his ship; and that after Saufeius had returned grain to one of them the ship went down. The question is asked if the others can proceed against Saufeius in respect of their share of the grain by raising an action for onus aversum. In a previous article, I studied the text for its stylistic qualities, especially its chiastic structure and the inferences about authorship that could be made on that basis. In this paper I intend to investigate further the nature and content of the otherwise unattested actio oneris aversi. To do so I divide the discussion into three parts: (1) Representing the text in light of my conclusions about authorship; (2) Additional considerations about the logical and rhetorical structure of the responsum; and (3) Investigation of the nature and content of the actio oneris aversi by comparison with the commission of the English tort of conversion in so-called ‘Wheat cases’. My conclusion is that the action lay for ‘conversion’ of a cargo, possessing similar features to an action for conversion in the common law. About the speaker Dr Peter Candy's research interests include Roman legal and economic history, with a focus on the relationship between economic development and legal change during the last centuries of the Roman Republic.

Through this workshop your participants will become more confident and relaxed in front of an audience which will translate into a successful speaking event.

Train the Trainer Training: Whether you are preparing to be a professional trainer, or you are someone who does a bit of training as a part of their job, you always want to be prepared. Your participants will understand that training is a process where skills, knowledge, and attitudes are applied in a unique way. Presentation Skills Training: In a survey carried out amongst experienced, middle and senior executives, designed to determine the things that they feared most, public speaking came out as number one. Death was eighth on the list! So, most of us would rather die than stand up and present! Practical Sales Skills Training: These practical sales skills training has been developed for salespeople or people who are required to sell as part of their role. This course is applicable for both people relatively new to sales as well as those who have a lot of experience as the content is flexible enough to adapt to suit the audience. Conflict Management Training: Disagreements, differences of opinion and conflicting perspectives on key issues inevitably arise in any context where people are working together. Research has shown that workplace conflicts can become highly destructive. Negative emotions may be stirred up, poisoning team morale, creating stress and destroying relationships. Power Query and Power Pivot for Excel Training: Power BI (including Power Query & Power Pivot) are the biggest Excel news items in the last 10 years. They give Excel users the power to draw information out of multiple sources, link it together then perform calculations on it that can then be sliced & diced any way you want.

To be successful, every organisation needs good managers. Manager Management  Training: With this course, you will be able to provide the skills, guidance, and empowerment to your team of managers. They will then be better suited in leading and motivating their team and thus produce fantastic results. To be a successful manager means having a wide range of skills.

Sales Presentation Mastery Training: Sales are the absolute most essential component of any business, and selling skills are the most highly valued skills in today’s business landscape. The world's fastest growing and most successful businesses have one thing in common: they have effective sales people that drive their business forward. Time Management Virtual Live Training: Personal time management skills are essential for professional success in any workplace.

NA,Sold out,NA,"""Youth Mental Health First Aid (MHFA®) courses are for everyone who works with, lives with or supports young people aged 8-18. They will teach you the skills and confidence to spot the signs of mental health issues in a young person, offer first aid and guide them towards the support they need. In doing so, you can speed up a young person’s recovery and stop a mental health issue from getting worse. Our courses won't teach you to be a therapist, but we will teach you to listen, reassure and respond, even in a crisis - and even potentially stop a crisis from happening. But more than that, we aim to give you the information and skills to look after your own mental health so that you can set an example for young people. By giving you the tools to have these conversations, we hope to empower you to create a mentally healthy, supportive environment in your family, school, peer group or community. Let's create a future where mental health is treated as a normal part of life, in the same way as physical health. A future where every young person has access to support if they need it.""
