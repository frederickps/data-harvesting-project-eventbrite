2 hours,Mobile eTicket,Contact the organiser to request a refund.,"A series of workshops with Jenny Moore Sunday 10 March 12-2pm Sunday 17 March 12-2pm - Book here Friday 12 April 10am-12pm (smaller capacity) - Book here What is it? These open workshops are a space for us to meet, connect, expand and play with the ritual of communal singing as a survival mechanism. To vibrate, vocalise, focus together, and to blow off some steam. You can expect physical and vocal warmups, quick cannons and group sonic meditations. Then, we will workshop songs from my new acclaimed choral musical, Wild Mix - a soaring 6-part song cycle with multi-layered vocals, intense beats, deeply personal and funny storytelling. Wild Mix asks: what does healing feel like? (more detail below) The invitation here is to use this music as a vehicle for channelling, connecting, sensing, moving and asking this question together. We will see what the songs do in the hands of the collective body for the first time! There will be space to reflect and share if that is friendly for you. Bring water, comfy clothes, and a curiousity for the material. Who‚Äôs it for? Open to everyone from professional singers, movers, performers, musicians & artists to anyone aching to open their mouths and sing. I‚Äôm interested in the multitudes of ways we vocalise, harmonise and fall into step and create worlds together. No experience is necessary. The Roof Studio at SDS is wheelchair accessible, warm and spacious, with natural light. (Access info below). Why? Sometimes I really do feel that I sing to stay alive. To gather myself up, to drop back into my body, and understand what‚Äôs going on in my heart and spirit, however uncomfortable. It helps me breathe deeper, or at least just breathe. It‚Äôs one of the only places I feel totally embodied ‚Äì where I can lose time, where I am less terrified. I see it as a place we can grow resilience, compassion for our own selves and safety in our own bodies. We connect to our personhood, values, loves, sorrows. I sing to be seen, to be in community, to practice vulnerability. To tell the truth. This is rooted in my own story as the founder and co-creator of F*Choir ‚Äì a queer feminist community choir that meets regularly to practice embodied polyphony, working on powerful music that feels hot in the moment and supports us in our daily lives. What‚Äôs Wild Mix, the show? Wild Mix is a new musical performed by a queer choir and crew of kickboxers. We are friends, lovers, colleagues, housemates. Rooted in communal singing, kickboxing and drumming, the show is built from these embodied practices that we use in our daily lives to practice queer survival and healing- For joy. To fall in step, to align, to experiment with our bodies after trauma. We try to tell the story of a body‚Äî the stuff that gets stuck in our muscles, cells, cortisol, bones, the trauma we carry that is beyond words. The storytelling and the methodologies we use are rooted in queer community and rely on the kinship that arises from co-created embodied practice. Jenny's unique blend of experience guides Wild Mix, exploring dissociation, C-PTSD, religious, and relational trauma through intuitive polyphonic composition and alternative communal music methodologies. ‚ÄúVisceral, innovative, alive, heartbreakingly honest, queer togetherness, a few of the words to describe last night. This made me feel things.‚Äù - audience feedback Who‚Äôs Jenny Moore? Jenny is a composer, singer, drummer and live artist originally from Canada. Voice and rhythm propels her compositional work, deep-rooted somatic storytelling is at the heart of her writing and directing. This practice works from the body, rhythm, oral / aural traditions, with the theories of muscular bonding and Deep Listening, and choreographic tools for tuning, sensing and expanding music. She believes music is a social creature, ripe for political movement. Jenny arranges and writes for F*Choir, offering complex, percussive ear-worms that challenge singers to be full-body vocalists, incorporating percussive elements and expanded vocal technique. 15 years of teaching and facilitation experience support her playful and heart-felt conducting style. ‚ÄãOther projects include: London-based choral-punk ensemble Jenny Moore‚Äôs Mystic Business known for their tuned percussion, huge vocals and chanted soulful mantras, a mix of the 90's R&B and post-punk Jenny grew up with. Their debut EP, ""He Earns Enough,"" was released on Lost Map Records in 2021, with The Piano Tapes Vol. 1, recorded live in St Barnabas, Dalston following in 2022. Her new experimental choral punk musical, Wild Mix - a queer kickboxing, drumming, singing ritual - is currently in development. She's a regular on the London DIY scene in bands like the dance-punk trio Charismatic Megafauna and Bas Jan, hosts a radio show on Soho Radio called 'Hitting Things,' and recently made her theatre debut as Composer for Robin Hood: The Legend Re-Written at Regents‚Äô Park Open Air Theatre Access and Amenities at Siobhan Davies Studios Siobhan Davies Studios is mostly accessible, with lifts to all floors.

3 hours,Mobile eTicket,Contact the organizer to request a refund.,"After a successful collaboration on a light show event in December, The Together Space and The Social Cinema are working together again to present SHORT/CUT - a screening of short animations plus a sensory art workshop to compliment these shorts. SHORT/CUT will take place at Switchboard Studios on Sunday 10th of March. There will be two screenings: Screening 1 from 2 - 3:15pm Screening 2 from 3:45 - 5pm The animations will run throughout the session with the sensory art workshop alongside it so children can choose how they would like to enjoy the cinematic experience. Whether it be sitting and watching the animations for the whole time, trying the art workshop whilst watching or doing a bit of both at different times. List of the short films to be screened: Cat and bird (Germany, 2021) 7‚Äô36‚Äù Dir. Franka Sachse A white bird living in a black world encounters a black cat living in a white world. The moment they meet, their backgrounds literally collide. Kuap (Switzerland, 2018) 7‚Äô38‚Äù Dir. Nils Hedinger A tadpole fails to develop into a frog like and is left behind by the others. But there's so much to experience in his small pond and the next spring is just around the corner. Pond (Switzerland, 2023) 8‚Äô30‚Äù Dir. Lena von D√∂hren, Eva Rust One small herring finds itself stranded in a tidal pool. As it searches for a way out, it discovers many other sea creatures there. And now there is no need for fear: by joining forces they can defend themselves against a hungry seagull. Kiki La Plume (France, 2020) 5‚Äô47‚Äù Dir. Julie Rembauville, Nicolas Bianco-Levrin Kiki only knows her cage. Her unexpected freedom brings not only danger but also friendship, adventure and the joy of flying. *All of these shorts are certified as U except Pond, which has a PG cert. due to mild threat: the herring and its friends are threatened by a seagull in search for its lunch but join forces to scare it away.* The Social Cinema have chosen short animations without dialogue to ensure the screenings are accessible to all children attending. The programme of shorts is designed to introduce children to unusual visual styles and animation techniques that are hard to find in mainstream family entertainment. The absence of dialogue is inclusive and also encourages all children to engage with a type of storytelling that creatively relies on other forms of communication other than verbal such music, gesture and sound. The Together Space run pop-up events around Walthamstow with a mission to tackle social segregation for children and young people with SEND and their families. The aim of these events is to provide an inclusive space for both disabled and non-disabled children/young people and their families. Research shows that children with SEND (Special Educational Needs and Disability) partake in fewer activities and participate less frequently than their peers without SEND. Going to the cinema is one of these activities which is why this collaboration is so meaningful for most of the families that attend The Together Space. This is a trial event in the hope of touring to different venues around the borough later in the year.",0,6.13,GBP,The Together Space,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-10T14:00:00Z,2024-03-10T17:00:00Z,The Together Space and The Social Cinema present SHORT/CUT,"A relaxed screening of shorts with no dialogue alongside a sensory art workshop to play with space, colour and texture.",https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-together-space-and-the-social-cinema-present-shortcut-tickets-845201419197,london

As the founder of SBSC this event is close to my heart because it reflects a personal mission to empower young women during a critical stage in their lives. At the age of 17-25, I experienced homelessness and displacement firsthand, and I deeply understand the challenges and lack of support many young women face during this time. This event is my way of giving back to the community and creating a space where young women feel seen, heard, and supported. While I plan to host inclusive events for everyone in the future, this particular event is designed specifically for this age group due to my personal connection and the unique needs of young women at this stage. I believe tailoring support to specific demographics allows me to offer the most impactful and relevant resources.

Whereas in our physical yoga practice (or asana) we focus on our breath, in kirtan we allow the mantras to become the focus of our mind as we become absorbed in the sound and the meaning of the words and travel on a journey within. The evening will begin with us giving gratitude and setting intentions with a delicious cup of ceremonial cacao - an ancient plant medicine which will open our hearts and raise our frequency to that which will allow our intentions to manifest. We will then journey into our practice of mantra meditation. We will sing and chant sacred mantras, allowing space for us to ask for and recieve guidance, and connect to the divinity within ourselves, each other, and the whole world around us. Throughout the evening we will discuss the meaning of the mantras and encourage you to find your own meaning within them. This is a beautiful and powerful practice for everyone - regardless of religion or background. All of our instruments are 100% vegan. Typically, instruments used in kirtan contain leather and the dead skin of animals which we feel to be contradictory to the energies of love we wish to cultivate and the messages of peace we are trying to send into the world. We wish to extend this compassion to all beings, so all of our instruments are vegan and/or use synthetic alternatives. All of the beautiful sound with none of the suffering. The ceremonial cacao we will use is vegan, organic and sustainably sourced from Peru and helps to support indigenous communities. No knowledge or experience of kirtan is required. The mantras will be on a screen for you to read and we will discuss each of them prior to chanting. This will be a safe space to release and take what you need. Just come as you are! „Ä∞Ô∏è Sunday 10th March 7-9pm „Ä∞Ô∏è Location: Love Shack, Cambridge Heath, E2 9HA „Ä∞Ô∏è Cup of cacao included (Note: If you are on antidepressants, pregnant, have high blood pressure or any heart condition, we do not recommend you to drink the cacao. If this is the case, let us know - we can offer you an alternative) „Ä∞Ô∏è Please bring something comfy for sitting on! „Ä∞Ô∏è We invite you to bring crystals or anything with meaning to you to add to our altar and charge with beautiful energy If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Molly (@_mollyelsdon) on instagram.

The walk will begin at: The ramp in front of the Boathouse Pub at the bottom of Brewhouse Lane (Find the location on: What3Words or Google Maps) Our guided foreshore walks help support our work to monitor and record the vulnerable archaeology on the Thames foreshore.

An excellent peaceful re-set for both heart and mind for the week ahead! This session includes: Gong, Himalayan Singing Bowls, Crystal Singing Bowls, and Chimes Lie back and let the specially designed Sound Bath take you into a state of deep, therapeutic, restorative relaxation.  The body holds onto our thoughts and emotions, which can become tension points and blockages over time. Sound healing relaxes and releases where your body needs it most at that particular time ... vibrational therapy is magical.   What to expect:  Wear comfy clothes, and bring something to lie on (mat or blanket), a pillow for your head or under your knees, and an eye mask or scarf.  A light blanket is a nice idea, too, since the body tends to cool in deep relaxation.  No movement is involved, and no fitness level or previous experience is required. You simply lie back on a mat whilst experiencing a variety of sound instruments played in certain ways, combinations, and sequences designed to address: My sound healing work is backed by up-to-the-minute medical and scientific research AND the time-tested wisdom of ancient practices.  Sound is good medicine!  PÔªøS: let me know if sitting in a chair is more comfortable for you than getting down on the floor, and I will provide one. Venue: the lovely, historic ETNA Community Centre in beautiful St Margarets, just over the bridge from Richmond.  Free parking in the building's lot. ETNA Community Centre is within easy walking distance of St Margaret‚Äôs Station, and 5 bus stops from Richmond Station (frequent service). Bus stop Poplar Court is just around the corner on Richmond / St Margarets Road. what3words ///button.ballots.shake How Sound Therapy works:  Sound is literally energy that we can hear and feel! And sound therapies can be a powerful form of energy healing. Sound waves can connect or ‚Äúentrain‚Äù with our brain waves to induce deep healing, and are often used in trauma therapy. This holistic practice works with sound wave frequencies to remediate the body's systems as an integrated whole.  Experiencing a Sound Bath can help return the body to a healthy state of ""flow"" by opening blockages in the body's systems, including circulatory, lymphatic, brain and nerves, endocrine (hormone), digestive, and immune.

3 hours,Mobile eTicket,No Refunds,"Cacao Ceremony themes:  Our ancestors understood and were sensitive to the changing seasons, the shifting states of nature and the effect that this had on their mental and physical bodies. We have become increasingly disconnected and so, we suffer physically and mentally. BUT more and more of us are responding to the need to reconnect to nature; humanity's great mirror. Even in the intensity of urban London we can reconnect. Cacao ceremony is one way to do so. Join us for a nourishing, nurturing and natural re-connection to & celebration of the cycles of nature. N ote: I send a guidance email a day or two before the ceremony. Please look out for this as sometimes it gets sent to people's spam box :-) A little on Ceremonial Cacao: Cacao is a heart-opening drink made from raw cacao bean paste - it is chocolate in its purest form. It gently but powerfully heightens and accelerates any personal development and transformations that you are working on/through at this time. Cacao will only work with your intentions and does not push you beyond your limits like other plant medicines. Most people experience drinking cacao as blissful and relaxing. To receive maximum benefits and maximum bliss, it is best to avoid caffeine on the day of the ceremony, avoid alcohol for at least 24 hours beforehand and avoid heavy meals on the day. Eat something light approx 2 hours prior to the ceremony. Arrive hydrated. Contraindications are those taking anti-depressants (cacao naturally boosts serotonin levels) , pregnant women and those with high blood pressure and/or heart disease. Please inform me if any of these apply to you and an alternative to cacao or a lower dose will be provided. This does not affect the impact that gathering in cacao ceremony can have upon your personal growth. Cacao ceremony reviews: Thank you as always for holding space and creating such a beautiful opportunity to heal, grow and learn! x F elicity's cacao ceremonies are really something special! Felicity is an excellent space holder and meditation guide. She guides you through the most beautiful meditation. Her cacao is divine. She offers wise insights into the oracle cards and the light circle is an incredibly powerful experience. Thank you for the deep healing Felicity, I can't wait to attend more events.

Is this 're-visiting' a valuable way to deepen our practice, to look at our creative preoccupations in new ways and from different perspectives? Do we only ever write one poem using different words? Can this make us feel stuck, and how do we liberate ourselves to go back, re-tread old ground and dig up new poetry bones?

2 hours,Mobile eTicket,No Refunds,"There are so many ways we can connect with psilocybin, and the wonderful thing about mushrooms is that they do different things at different doses. Lenna will talk about her own personal experience and her long-standing relationship with psilocybin, how it helped her recover from life-long depression, as well her experiences guiding people through psychedelic journeys. She will also touch on the importance of preparation and integration and how these two important phases can help you to get the most out of a psychedelic experience. What to expect Expect great discussion, a chance to ask lots of questions, and building community over our signature rose tea! If you have any questions that you would specifically like Lenna to address, please note these upon booking. About Lenna: Lenna is the founder of Shift Happens - a holistic healing & psychedelic integration platform which aims to support people on their journey of psychedelic exploration. Her own integration began when she experienced a profound encounter with Ayahuasca, which led to a spiritual emergency due to lack of support, stability or internal framework. Through navigating this crisis, she discovered inner resources, practices and tools to integrate those difficult experiences and eventually began supporting other‚Äôs to do the same. During this time she found a strong ally in the mushrooms which helped her to peel back the layers of trauma, conditioning and limiting beliefs that were causing her life-long depression. She formed a deep connection with these teachers and believes that taking the time to create a relationship with them can be life changing. Lenna remains connected to the psychedelic realms but keeps her feet firmly on the ground straddling both the mystical and the everyday reality of being human. Lenna‚Äôs approach is relatable, grounded and centres on empowering her clients to become their own guides and healers.

The film is a celebration of the ephemerality of youth and a love letter to the underground community partying at Funky Town, an unassuming corner bar hidden by Chengdu‚Äôs construction crane. For a vibrant group of DJs, drag performers, lovers, ravers, and skaters, Funky Town is a sanctuary for underground partying; the one place that accepts them for who they really are.

Have you been recently feeling a bit overwhelmed, stressed or disconnected with yourself and others? Chances are that your energetic centre has been thrown of its equilibrium at some point and only now symptoms of that have come to the surface of your consciousness.  Sacral chakra is closely linked to our adrenal glands, sexual organs and the way we process water in our bodies. Our fight and flight responses are commonly triggered by stress that stimulates release of adrenaline, which is a normal reaction that helps our body and mind coping better at a given time. Prolonged exposure to stress causes chronic illnesses. Emotions like fear and anger are common triggers of this state. By stimulating Sacral Chakra area we are going to be focusing on relaxing these responses down and activating so called lower road of our fight and flight responses, where we take our time to evaluate and cope in a much calmer manner. This process helps getting in touch with our own inner sense of joy that we will be establishing a path to in this session.  It is more important than ever to be intentional in this day and age, we will focus on a complete de-strestressing, cleansing and an intention setting.  Sound healing is a practice that uses harmonic vibrations to harmonise brainwaves: combining sound therapy with hypnotherapy and other healing modalities, we achieve distressing, brain fog removal and a deeper meditative state.  Hypnotherapy is a completely safe method allowing a deeper connection within our selves elevating the effects of sound therapy.  Hand in hand it is an incredible combination.  The session will start with a light grounding meditation and a healing touch, followed by carefully selected sound journey frequencies activating your sacral chakra, sealing the session with hypnotherapy which will deepen your experience.

Although we do not undertake garment repairs we usually offer those enquiring two options for repairs. The first option we recommend is that the person try using a dry cleaners to undertake the job. However, we always point out that this can often work out as an expensive option. Along with that option we always try to encourage the person to try to carrying out the repair themselves, offering advice on ways that they might achieve this. Sadly, in recent years, and maybe as a result our growing ‚Äúthrow away‚Äù culture, there has been a marked decline in the practice of learning even the most basic of clothing repair skills. As such, many of us now lack a real understanding of the various stitching techniques and tricks, used in basic fabric repairs. This is also the case with traditional weaving and darning techniques used to mend and prolong the life of our cherished woollen garments. In light of this situation, Barley has put together a comprehensive hand repair workshop focusing on common woollen garment repairs. The workshop is not only very informative, but also very enjoyable encouraging a really mindful approach to clothing repairs. On completion of the class participants will confidently be able to: - Use 2 types of 'Darning' techniques: Traditional Weave & Swiss Darning - Apply techniques to different weights of woolens from fine cashmere jumpers to chunky hand knits - Explore 'Visible Mending' -Ôªø Learn how to re stitch unravelled seams and cuffs. - Consider different colour combinations and creative features. - Work on your own mending pile!

This recognition acknowledges the immense sacrifices, hard work and unconditional love that mothers provide to their children, families and the world. This concept of motherhood is not limited to biological mothers. Adoptive mothers, stepmothers, foster mothers and other maternal figures can embody pillars of wisdom and take on such nurturing roles. The essence of motherhood is not solely defined simply by genetics but by the care and dedication a person passes on to someone they love. We also use the term ""Mother Earth"" or pachamama to personify the Earth itself as a nurturing and life-giving entity that provides sustenance and support for all living beings. Furthermore, the mother figure embodies the cycle of birth, growth, death, and rebirth that characterises the natural world. Is there someone you want to remember this Mother's day? A protector, a fighter, a healer? Is there someone you want to pay tribute to or celebrate? Perhaps you felt lacking of a mother's spirit and would like a safe space to acknowledge that missing, a nuturing place of empowerment, a circle filled with inspiring women, the collective 'mother'.

 Hampstead Heath is one of the largest and most popular green spaces in the Greater London area. It is only 4 miles from central London but it feels like 4,000 miles from the bustle of the city. The Heath covers roughly 790 acres (about 360 hectares) and runs along a sandy ridge between Highgate to the east and Hampstead to the south-west.
 The park includes popular recreational facilities, including three open-air swimming pools.
 
 We will meet at Hampstead tube station and we will walk to the heath together.
 We will stop at Kenwood House and we will have a drink or a snack at Brew Caf√©, outside.
 Then, we will walk back to the tube station.
 Please note that we walk approximately 50 minutes to arrive at Kenwood House and it takes the same time to go back to Hampstead Station.
 
 I don‚Äôt encourage any late comer because the heath is huge. If you are late, just head to Kenwood House to meet us.
 I will leave our live location on google map on our WhatsApp group.
 
 Please bring a warm jumper and a raincoat, you may need them. I also recommend to wear good walking shoes. The heath can be muddy at this time of the year.

This unique event combines the soothing practice of Tai Chi with the expressive power of vocals. Discover the art of harmonizing body movements and vocal techniques in a relaxed and friendly environment.In 2009 Jenni asked herself the question: ""How can I improvise while meditating?"" Vocal Tai Chi was her answer.Vocal Tai Chi is a vocal improvisation practice, rooted in a slow, grounded yet flowing bodywork practice - inspired by Tai Chi, while working with vocal improvisation, drone, modal scales and an inquiry into the vast array of timbres the voice holds, in the service of authentic vocal expression, artistic journey and healing process.The taster workshops in Vocal Tai Chi are a basic introduction to the principles and practice of Vocal Tai Chi - ""a voice-life practice for the whole self.""This is a single afternoon workshop, all comers are welcome, for refreshers or to taste for the first time. Come to one, or come to more than one.Taster workshops (2pm - 6pm) take place on a Sunday. There is another one on March 10th and another on May 5th.These are stand alone sessions, but can be used as a stepping stone towards the Foundation half module - taking place in April 2024 (four afternoons over two weekend) or indeed, the full apprenticeship in Vocal Tai Chi (begins September 2024 - 3 full modules).(5 practitioners were certified in September 2023 to practice Vocal Tai Chi with groups and individuals.)The afternoon is divided in two: group work 2pm-4pm, and (creatively witnessed) individual work 4pm - 6pm. Creative witnessing is an active response practice to your fellow workshop participant as they work on their solo voice with Jenni. It is like witness-learning. Each participant will have a solo session during the taster workshop and all will be witnessed in this way."" I think Jenni managed to find a very good balance between following a well thought out course structure, whilst being very open to how the energy of the group might take things in a different direction."" Damien. Whether you are a seasoned singer or just curious about exploring your voice, these workshops offer a fun and interactive experience. Led by an experienced instructor, you will learn simple Tai Chi exercises that help improve breath control, posture, and vocal resonance. During the workshop, you'll get the chance to explore different vocal exercises, including warm-ups, breathing techniques, and vocal improvisation. No previous experience is required, so come as you are and be ready to embrace your voice! The Vocal Tai Chi Taster Workshops will take place on February 4th, March 10th and May 5th. All Sunday afternoon sessions. The event will be held at Exchange House, a convenient and welcoming venue located in North London, a 10 minute bus ride away from Archwy and Finsbuy Park Tubes.

NA,Sold out,Contact the organiser to request a refund.,"A typical puppy yoga class will have approximately 6-10 puppies with around 15 participants and the puppies can range from 8-14 weeks old. Puppy yoga classes involve having puppies roaming from one mat to the next, leaping on participants, and tussling with other puppies as you try out different yoga poses. Often pups are incorporated into some of the yoga poses or they happily roam free throughout class. All puppies are borrowed from a local breeder and we find the breeders from websites such as Kennel Club or Pets4Homes. On some occasions, Puppy Yoga gives the puppies an opportunity to be adopted, if they haven‚Äôt already found their forever home. The puppies get the chance to be around other people (not just their breeder) which enhances their socialisation. In the first 3 months of a puppies life it is very important to expose your puppies to different people, new environments, sounds and smells. Puppy yoga is a safe and fun space that aids with our puppies socialisation. When you cuddle a puppy, it has psychological benefits, increasing the happy hormones: oxytocin and serotonin to the brain and lowering cortisol levels (the negative hormone) similar to when you embrace a new-born baby for the first time. This in turn with the yoga, will leave you feeling physically , mentally and emotional balanced and fulfillled. For health and safety reasons an Adult must attend and supervise the child.

NA,Sold out,Contact the organizer to request a refund.,"Join us moving outdoors in this beauiful SE London park because natural spaces give something to the body, to movement, the way we feel and the way we understand nature, that we are in love with and would like to share.  ‚Äã It is a format where actions or 'undoing' derive from listening to what it is we need or want at this given time in this given space. We soften the edges of what we think we need to do, adjusting our methods and exercises to what feels right and where our curiosity leads us. That may be exercises but it might also be lying in the grass, throwing back a ball to a child, cartwheeling or perceiving tiny shifts of weight on an uneven grassy ground. It is an initiative of dancers to improvise and tune with what is present through dances but we consider any kind of movement to be a dance! We consider all movement to reflect an understanding of how we make sense of ourselves and what we are with, increasingly fine tuning our attention on how movement transcends our personal body into shared rhythms, energies, breath and where gravity and space nurture a dynamic togetherness by dancing with nature. We will give a little intro to begin with but once set, it is up to you to move in any way you like. Simple, complex, still dynamic - whatever you are and bring is welcome!

Treat your mom to a day of relaxation and fun with adorable puppies. Join us for a unique yoga session filled with puppy cuddles and playtime. It‚Äôs the perfect way to celebrate Mother‚Äôs Day and create lasting memories. Don‚Äôt miss out on this special event! A typical puppy yoga class will have Come and share the puppy love and cuddles with your loved one or family/ friends. Cuddles in abundance for all guaranteed! approximately 6-10 puppies with around 15 participants and the puppies can range from 8-14 weeks old. Puppy yoga classes involve having puppies roaming from one mat to the next, leaping on participants, and tussling with other puppies as you try out different yoga poses. Often pups are incorporated into some of the yoga poses or they happily roam free throughout class. All puppies are borrowed from a local breeder and we find the breeders from websites such as Kennel Club or Pets4Homes. On some occasions, Puppy Yoga gives the puppies an opportunity to be adopted, if they haven‚Äôt already found their forever home. The puppies get the chance to be around other people (not just their breeder) which enhances their socialisation. In the first 3 months of a puppies life it is very important to expose your puppies to different people, new environments, sounds and smells. Puppy yoga is a safe and fun space that aids with our puppies socialisation. When you cuddle a puppy, it has psychological benefits, increasing the happy hormones: oxytocin and serotonin to the brain and lowering cortisol levels (the negative hormone) similar to when you embrace a new-born baby for the first time. This in turn with the yoga, will leave you feeling physically , mentally and emotional balanced and fulfillled. For health and safety reasons an Adult must attend and supervise the child.

Emanating a voluptuous sensual scent, Rose, like the goddess Isis and Venus, is the manifestation of love and fully embodies the Divine Feminine and Divine Mother on Earth. She reconnects us with the Mother Goddess so that we can embody her qualities, transform anything that keeps us separated from ourselves and reawakens our healing power. Rose oil makes a powerful anointing oil for the energetic heart centre. To learn about Rose Sacred Oil https://sothistemple.com/sacredoilssoulessence/rose ABOUT THE VENUS PLANETARY GONG* The Venus gong resonates at the approximate musical note of A, associated with our 3rd Eye Chakra (or 1st Eye) inspiring creativity and invoking the spirit of feminine energy. Venus/Isis is the embodiment of Divine Love and the Divine Feminine principles. When we are bathed in a sound bath with the atmospheric and soothing Venus gong, we are compelled to drop our protective armour and surrender in the arms of the Great Mother. Its harmonious resonance is joyfull, loving and compassionate, helping to drop into a state of acceptance and surrendering. Restore the frequencies of gratitude and appreciation and allowing the divine plan to unfold with trust in the flow of life we rediscover the Joy of life and creative inspiration *Planetary gongs are made using the calculations of Hans Cousto (The Cosmic Octave) to match the frequencies of the sun, moon, and planets; each gong is tuned to produce the corresponding frequency. REVIEWS FROM PREVIOUS EVENTS ""I had the most beautiful experience last night! The sound bath was extraordinary and I have gone from feeling extremely uptight to at peace and reconnected to my body!

2 hours,Mobile eTicket,Contact the organiser to request a refund.,"Have you ever felt the need to explore your inner self and experience profound spiritual growth? If so, you'll be intrigued by KAP - Kundalini Activation Process. Founded by Venant Wong, KAP offers a unique journey towards awakening the Kundalini energy within you, leading to non-dual states of consciousness. Unlike other practices that require personal willpower, KAP is about surrender, not effort. KAP distinguishes itself from practices like Kundalini yoga, tantra, and chi gong by offering a direct energy transmission. It's akin to Shakti pat and requires only one thing ‚Äì the ability to let go and receive. KAP gently activates energy centers, from the crown to the root chakra, releasing blockages and fostering deeper connections with yourself, others, and higher states of consciousness. This intelligent energy adapts to your specific needs in the moment, offering a unique and personal experience. Every KAP session is an individual journey. Some participants laugh, cry, dance, or have profound realizations. Spontaneous movements can occur, and with continued exposure, a transformative rewiring of the brain and central nervous system takes place. Common signs of Kundalini awakening are regularly experienced. However, it's not about what happens during the session; it's about the profound unblocking of your energy centers and your deeper connection to intuition and authenticity. In our open class, immerse yourself in a carefully curated playlist of enchanting music while you lie down on a comfortable mat, close your eyes, and let go. The KAP facilitator will guide the energy transmission, occasionally touching different chakra/meridian points on your body. Experiences can Include: Energetic sensations Visual experiences, from an active third eye to astral journeys Emotional release (Crying, laughing, anger, sadness, joy, and bliss) Kinaesthetic movements, stretches, and yoga poses Blissful states KAP offers a wide range of benefits, from spiritual growth to healing mind, body, and soul. Participants often report: Deepening of consciousness Removal of energetic blocks Connection to higher self and source Relief from anxiety and depression Overall well-being Sarvenaz, trained by KAP Academy, is thrilled to guide you on this extraordinary journey. Comfortable clothing Avoid eating heavily for 3 hours prior to the session (a light snack like fruit is fine) Refrain from alcohol or substances 24 hours before the session If you prefer, bring a yoga mat; otherwise, one will be provided for you.

Join us in community over two weekends at Berkeley Farm in Hainault to connect to the land and bring you the knowledge and hands on experience to design and create a forest garden. ¬† Rakesh ‚ÄúRootsman Rak‚Äù is an experienced permaculture and forest gardening designer and teacher. He will coordinate all participants to help make a real forest garden design for Berkeley Farm. You will learn his design tools, learning the many tools Rakesh has in his permaculture and forest gardening toolbox. ¬† We are all too well aware of the challenges the world faces, especially in our food growing systems. This course shows us how to address many of these issues by making low maintenance, nutrient dense, biodiverse rich food growing systems know as food forests or forest gardening. We will also add many additional features to the design using Permaculture design. ¬† So if you are interested in ecology; helping to increase biodiversity; sequester carbon; manage greenhouse gases; cool your surroundings while growing nutrient dense foods, soaps, medicines, crafting materials, etc but with minimum effort i.e. where nature does the work, and enriches itself, then this course is for you. ¬† First Weekend: Designing forest gardens9th-10th March 2024, 9am-5pm ¬† Imagine your garden or community space looking as lovely as a woodland edge. Imagine that on top of looking wonderfully wild, it produces an abundance of nutrient dense food and will ultimately need very little digging, weeding, manual watering or pest control - all in harmony with animals and other beings (eco friendly and vegan). This is ‚Äòan edible forest garden‚Äô. ¬† Forest gardening is a way of growing food where nature does most of the work for you. Modelled on natural woodland, crops are grown in different layers from high and medium sized canopy to roots, ground cover and climbers. And its not just food and medicine you will get from the forest garden, there are many more yields. ¬† Through careful planning plants are chosen which have beneficial effects on each other, attract beneficial insects and create a healthy biodiverse rich system that maintains its own fertility. Once established, your main task will be harvesting! The course is designed so you will learn how to make a forest garden anywhere, including your own home, while also making a real design for Berkeley Farm. ¬† Over the 2 days you will learn about the basics of designing a forest garden. You will get to understand- How to select the right plants for your environment- Where to place them to ensure they thrive- How to ensure you have the right nutrients cycling to ensure good crops- History of forest gardening- Why make a food forest- Layout of a forest garden- Multifunctional pathways- Creating abundance and resilience- Low maintenance food growing- Patterns in nature for forest gardens- Understanding and maximising edge You will put all of this into action by helping to design a real forest garden for the farm. Second Weekend: Permaculture Design16th-17th March 2024 9am-5pm ¬† Over the 2 days you will learn about the basics of permaculture design. You will get to understand- Permaculture ethics and how to use them to make ethical choices- Permaculture principles and how to use them to strengthen designs- A design methodology to simplify and make designs easier and more robust- Water management strategies- Soil improvement strategies- Land management strategies- Low maintenance food growing systems ¬† You will put all of this into action by helping to design a real forest garden for Berkeley Farm. ¬† The course will be led by Rakesh ‚ÄúRootsman Rak‚Äù - experienced Permaculture designer, teacher and Forest Garden specialist, yoga teacher and homeopath. He has been growing food since he was a child, and has been designing and teaching edible landscaping, permaculture, forest gardening, etc since 2009. Rakesh has designed and implemented forest gardens from small-scale private gardens and schools, to farms, community gardens, communal nature gardens, as well as helping design and implement forest gardens for various eco villages. ¬† Location: Berkeley FarmManor Rd, Lambourne End,Romford, RM4 1NH,United Kingdom ¬† Boots and appropriate clothing requested, bring your own lunch.
