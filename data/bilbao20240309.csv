NA,Sold out,NA,"You have a glorious opportunity to get your message into the world. Never before has there been such an exciting time in communication. The ability to transmit your words across the world has existed for decades. What has changed a result of COVID-19 is now people are LISTENING. Virtual communication has now been accepted as the norm. People know that they need to tune into the Facebook Lives and join the Zoom meetings otherwise they are going to be left out of the loop. They are ready to hear your message. Are you ready to give it to them? Your phone and your computer are all you need to make a difference in the world. You have a voice, it’s time to use it. You have a story, it’s time to tell it. You have a message, it’s time to share it. Imagine being able to reach people in places you’ve never heard of and changing the lives of people you have never met. That possibility is more real than ever thanks to virtual speaking. You still aren’t 100% sure about all this, are you? You’ve done some Facebook Lives, you’ve been in some Zoom meetings and you’ve filmed a few selfie videos. You’re trying things out, but you’re not as confident as you’d like to be. It still feels weird not being able to see people. You still feel self conscious seeing yourself on camera. You aren’t getting the likes and comments that you see other people getting on their lives and videos. Does it feel like you’ve been left behind by all this change? You haven’t been left behind yet…but you will if you don’t act now. When the technology arrived to do virtual speaking, only a tiny fraction of people adopted it. During the 2010s they rose to the top of their fields. The “second wave” is now here, and you’ve got to catch it if you want to have a meaningful impact during the 2020s. I joined the second wave late. I started my Youtube channel in 2015, 10 years after Youtube had been created. I first used Zoom in 2018, 5 years after Zoom had been created. I was quicker on the uptake with Facebook Live, being one of the first people in my industry to use it in 2016. I didn’t have the audience nor the engagement of my peers, but I kept learning the craft. When lockdown hit in 2020, I was able to seamlessly transition my business online. I’d been preparing for half a decade to speak virtually whilst the competition got caught with their pants down. I managed to grow my audience and increase my income in 2020 when so many businesses struggled or even sadly closed up shop. There’s one thing that made the difference for me and it will make the difference for you too. I knew how to communicate online. I was far more confident with the tech, more practiced in the communication and more open to the switch to virtual. We still have people who don’t know how to unmute themselves on Zoom. We still have people who speak like an emotionless robot on their Youtube videos. We still have people who think virtual was just a “phase” and not a transition into a new way of doing things. Don’t be one of those people. The second wave of virtual communication is here...are you going to jump on it? This is going to be far bigger than the first wave. If you don’t jump on now, you will get swept away. Equally, if you put in the work now to master virtual speaking, you are going to flourish for the next decade. That is what this Virtual Speaking Masterclass is going to help you do. There are three basic building blocks you need to be a great virtual speaker. Firstly you will learn how to make friends with the camera. Making friends with the camera means that you will: Secondly you will learn why it’s so important to create an “active window”. An active window means that you: Thirdly you will learn how to effectively interact with your audience. Strong interaction means that your audience will: Are you ready for the second wave? Then grab your surfboard and sign up for the masterclass! In the true spirit of Virtual Speaking, we will of course be hosting this class virtually so that you can join us from the comfort of your own home. FAQs Is this definitely an online event? Because the event has a physical location? Yes this is entirely online. The physical location allows people in your city (such as you!) to find the event as it shows up as being geographically close to them. Where can I access the masterclass? You can attend the masterclass live on Zoom. You will be sent the link on the day of the masterclass. The event repeats each month, do I need to attend on a monthly basis? No. The same series is repeated every month. You only need to attend one event.",0,0,GBP,David McCrae,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-09T19:00:00Z,2024-03-09T20:30:00Z,Virtual Speaking Masterclass Bilbao,Online Workshop Teaching You How To Speak Online!,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/virtual-speaking-masterclass-bilbao-tickets-774550089167,bilbao

NA,Sold out,No Refunds,"Awaken your mind and body to a new level and learn how to practice meditation in motion. The purpose of this yoga lineage is to guide you toward cultivating a conscious connection, integration and awakening of the body, mind, heart and spirit. You will learn and practice Patanjali's 8 limbs of yoga: Work primarily with the Amrit posture sequence, gentle vinyasa flows and extended posture holding times. Explore the deepest levels of body, mind and spirit with the integrative practices of clear intention, breath, meditative awareness and conscious integration. Learn to balance your nervous system with the “first half” and “second half” of a posture. To transition from an active state of “doing” a posture, to a relaxed state of “being”. And to feel the effects of a posture. Learn to consciously encounter your ""edge"" of body and mind to release deep tensions and restore the natural flow of the vital life force energy (prana). Good for all levels, from those with some experience to more experienced practitioners. Some experience with yoga and postures is recommended. BIOGRAPHY I have been guiding spiritual seekers for over 30 years with the self-transformative teachings of yoga, meditation, Ayurveda and breathing. It is my pleasure and honor to guide you toward self-empowerment, transformation and awakened consciousness. I will help you connect to your deepest self and inner guide, from the physical to the soul dimension.
