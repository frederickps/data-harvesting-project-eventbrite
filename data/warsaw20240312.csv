Mind ReMapping You may read this today and wonder, what values can we learn from Mind ReMapping? Your Mind is an atomic and perpetual energy. Its power is so complex that it carries no mass, but yet, derives energy not only from the natural sustainability of surrounding environments, but it perpetuates far greater power with the connections it makes with other minds where at our collective nucleus, is a nuclear energy which is unstoppable. This power, which for most of us is dormant, inspires its own potent energies, deriving power from genuine and respectful gestures we gift through the interactions we have with one another, in the simplest of, “Hellos, & how are you?” Its only through a connection with other minds, not money, nor possessions, that can pull us out of our lowest moments in life’s darkness, because nothing, not even FEAR, can survive the deep depths of Time, where FEAR abandons us to insanity or, we find salvation through a connection with other minds. However, the mind's energy when synchronised is unrivalled, as there is nothing more gargantuan than collective minds coming together because the mind must first perceive before it can conceive. Collective Minds that are empathic to one another are designed to create wormholes in Time, where either the greatest ideas are birthed, or where our worst nightmares are channelled through time. Wormholes in Time, of course, can be achieved in their singularities which can be truly exhilarating or horrific, but the wormholes we create together, open vaster passages in Time through which powers of Consciousness can manifest itself to us, in whatever we have asked it to become. That power to some, can present itself to be God, to some, it can be Spirituality, and to others, it can be the Sciences, the Arts, or any means where Consciousness can reach us through OPEN TIME. Imagine these wormholes as transmission gateways to higher or lower Dimensions, that for humans, are situated in the only place where Time can travel, whilst carrying our perceptions with it. That place is the 4 Dimensions of our Minds. At this point, we realise why our minds are so powerful because they are PORTALS of TIME, and why, we are often kept divided, pitting advantages against one another over trivial conflicts, because we have forgotten who we are. We are not aware we are lowering our status as a species which redirects Times energy toward alternative sources that close time, straining and weakening mind transmissions. However, what is being attempted above all our own primitive needs, is that certain Timelines of Consciousness are being fragmented. Consciousness is an intelligence of unities, where strength in numbers creates infinities which either, flourish in life, or instead, are infinities that perpetuate repetitive downward spirals. The next revolution is not going to be the takeover of A.I. as we are sold and told because it is too obvious, it instead, will be the invisible Decimations of minds only looking out for themselves, or it will be the Raptures of people who know their Minds, bringing Times of life, together.
