7 uren 30 minuten,Neem contact op met de organisator om een restitutie aan te vragen.,"Wanneer we hard aan het werk zijn, zijn we ons meestal niet zo bewust van de signalen die ons lichaam ons geeft. Zo kan een werkdag soms zo voorbijvliegen en vergeten we dat we honger hebben, dat we naar het toilet moeten of dat we behoefte hebben aan een pauze; we gaan soms door terwijl we doodmoe zijn. 
 Doordat je constant signalen mist, raak je het contact met jezelf kwijt en ontstaan er vaak lichamelijke klachten zoals moeheid, rugpijn, oorsuizen of hoofdpijn. Wanneer klachten en problemen toenemen kan er minder ruimte komen voor de ontspanning, het plezier en de bevlogenheid waar je op je werk naar streeft. Dat proberen we als mensen op te lossen door nog meer te gaan denken. Maar door nog meer na te denken zal er weinig veranderen.

1 hour 30 minutes,Contact the organizer to request a refund.,"The Full Moon is a good time to look at three areas of your life: emotional/spiritual balance, health and career. During that period we might feel some emotions stronger or fuller. This is a perfect way for an overworked body and busy mind to slow down and be at peace. After this session you will leave more serene with a deeper understanding of yourself and be more in touch with your surroundings. For some of the participants it feels like a big weight is taken off their shoulders or the feeling of having been put back into one piece. Some felt the vibrations reached deep inside their body helping to release tension. I have received feedback from the previous groups that it helped them with their clenched jaw, upset stomach, sleeping difficulties and in general it has been described as a very grounding experience. IMPORTANT INFORMATION: - Places are limited - The organizer reserves the right to cancel the event at any time with a full refund - Tickets are non-refundable but you can give away your place to the new owner Sound healing and Sound baths in groups can enable and guide us into a deep trance moment of being. Much akin to lucid dreaming, it is a very present state a right here and now, moving between being firmly grounded yet travelling through the ether like substance of our subconscious. We ourselves as well as everything around us, is at its core in constant vibration. Sound journeys encourage an alignment of these vibrations through self-resonance. It is a re-tuning of our body on a molecular level. Much like waves travelling in a pond of water, sound waves are not only perceived on an auditory level by bringing our ear drums into motion; clear and rhythm frequency modulations encouraged by a medium largely based on water (our bodies) are also perceived on a more subtle level. They reach deep inside moving us on an atomic level. This self-resonance balances our bodies to a natural level, enabling deep states of trance like meditation . They re-tune our own most beautiful instrument, our bodies and minds. They can shake und unblock energetic flows, allowing us to reconnect with ourselves, our ambitions and freeing emotions hidden away in our subconscious. Sound healing, wave by wave brings us closer to that state of calmness and feeling of completeness that every human longs for in their journey of life. One of the big advantages of the session is unlocking a creativity. I treat sound sessions as sound ceremonies. To me it‚Äôs about a unique experience where you are guided by the sound, their vibrations and frequencies. I combine my range of instruments with my voice through singing and chanting. During this session, together with intuitive singing, instruments such as quartz crystal singing bowls, chimes, ocean drum, Shruti box and gong will be played around the body. Vocal exercises will show you the healing power of your own voice. Benefits of Sound Therapy: - Calms the nervous system, - Activates self healing within the body, - Reduces stress, - Promotes a deeper sleep, - Breaks down emotional and physical blockages, - Provides a deep state of relaxation, - Unlocks creativity, - Boosts immunity, - Reduces pain (endorphins release), - Relieves or lessens anxiety and depression. - This workshop is for everyone, no meditation experience necessary.

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

Je hoofd draait overuren en je zorgt beter voor anderen dan voor jezelf. Onbewust vragen we veel van ons lichaam. Aandacht voor je hoofd √©n lichaam We proberen onszelf vooral via ons hoofd te begrijpen en te veranderen. Echter weet je hoofd niet altijd wat het beste is voor jou als geheel. Lichaamswerk voegt jouw eigen lichaam toe als waardevolle ingang om jezelf op een diepere laag te leren kennen. Los van overtuigingen, patronen, herinneringen en oordeel. Door liefdevolle, aandachtige aanraking kom je uit je hoofd en maak je ruimte om de wijsheid van je eigen lichaam te voelen. Want daar mag je op vertrouwen. Een aanraking die je leven veranderd. Bewustwording en groei De basis van mijn lichaamsgerichte & intu√Øtieve werkwijze is mijn passie om anderen te begeleiden het leven te gaan leven dat in de kern bij ze past. Door aandachtig te kijken naar de relatie die je met jezelf en je lichaam hebt wordt inzichtelijk welke patronen je in de weg staan om echt voor jezelf te kiezen en te herkennen wat je batterij leegzuigt.

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

NA,Neem contact op met de organisator om een restitutie aan te vragen.,"Hatha yoga is de meest klassieke vorm van yoga. Hatha yoga werd vroeger beoefend door monniken die milde lichaamsbeweging nodig hadden naast het vele mediteren (en als voorbereiding op het mediteren). De yogahoudingen van hatha yoga houd je langer vast, zonder dat het oncomfortabel wordt.Spanningen verdwijnen hierdoor uit het lichaam, waardoor je tijdens de meditatie ook langer en comfortabeler kunt zitten. Je bent je met deze yogastijl dus ultiem aan het voorbereiden op je meditatie. Maar hatha yoga is meer dan alleen bewegen en de yogahoudingen goed uitvoeren. Want juist de verbinding tussen lichaam en geest is heel belangrijk binnen deze stijl. Ha-Tha betekent zon en maan, welke binnen de yoga gezien worden als tegenstrijdigheden.De zon staat namelijk voor actie, vurig en mannelijk. De maan staat voor verinnerlijking, kalmerend en vrouwelijk. Binnen hatha komen de kenmerken van de zon en de maan samen. ************************************************************************** Yoga, meditatieles, en Pilates doe je bij stichting !Triggr met een geldig abonnement.

NA,Neem contact op met de organisator om een restitutie aan te vragen.,"Yin yoga Yin yoga is een zachte, langzame, meditatieve vorm van yoga. Houdingen worden voor langere tijd vastgehouden, meestal 3-5 minuten, maar het kan zelfs nog langer. Hierdoor ontstaat er een (lichte) weerstand in de gebieden waarvoor de houding bedoeld is. De spieren ontspannen zoveel mogelijk, mede met behulp van props om het lichaam te ondersteunen. Door deze lange duur en ontspanning treedt er effect op in de dieperliggende delen van het lichaam en wordt het bindweefsel gestimuleerd, dat zich bevindt rondom bv. spieren en gewrichten. Als je weer uit de houding komt is het tijd om na te voelen wat een houding met je lichaam gedaan heeft. De drie hoofdprincipes. Je komt in een houding en voelt je eerste grens. Waar kun je blijven voor een aantal minuten? Je wordt stil. Om door te dringen tot de weefsels die dieper in je lichaam liggen word je stil en houd je de spieren zacht. Je houdt de houding voor langere tijd vast, zodat je weefsels de tijd krijgen en je kunt observeren wat zich aandient. Waar is yin yoga goed voor? Een yin yogales is dus goed voor gewrichten, bindweefsel, ligamenten en botten, en kalmeert het zenuwstelsel. Yin yoga stimuleert ook je energetische lichaam, doordat bepaalde meridianen worden gestimuleerd in de houdingen. Yin yoga is een fantastische vorm van yoga als tegenhanger van de drukte die we allemaal dagelijks ervaren. Doordat een houding voor langere tijd wordt aangehouden is er tijd om grenzen te ontdekken, stil te worden en dieper te voelen wat er is in het lichaam. Er is focus op mindfulness en ademhaling in de houdingen, waardoor enige opgekomen weerstand geobserveerd kan worden. De stilte en zachtheid kunnen je dus heel erg bij jezelf brengen en je hebt tijd om te zien welke inzichten er soms naar boven komen. Tijd om te oefenen met compassie voor jezelf en jouw proces. Tijd om te luisteren naar jouw lichaam en naar wat het nodig heeft. Hoewel het een zachte en langzame vorm van yoga is betekent dit niet dat het ook altijd gemakkelijk is. Het is bij deze vorm van yoga erg belangrijk dat je de grenzen van je eigen kunnen in de gaten houdt. ************************************************************************** Yoga, meditatieles, Tai Chi en Pilates doe je bij stichting !Triggr met een geldig abonnement.

NA,Neem contact op met de organisator om een restitutie aan te vragen.,"Klassiek Pilates volgt d√© traditionele bewegingsmethode ontwikkeld door Joseph Pilates. (1883 ‚Äì 1967), een gedreven en briljant docent, die zijn methode ‚ÄúThe Art of Contrology‚Äù noemde. Contrology is de algehele co√∂rdinatie van lichaam en geest. De methode focust op de dieper liggende spieren in het lichaam, op concentratie en op ademhaling. Het versterkt de spieren in het hele lichaam en maakt het lichaam soepel en lenig door middel van een serie vloeiende, dynamische bewegingen. Ook de kleine spieren worden getraind, en juist deze spieren zorgen voor een sterke fundering van het lichaam en, daarmee, voor een goede houding. Zonder dat je er bewust van bent ga je rechter zitten en lopen, gracieuzer bewegen en zal je beter slapen. Het gaat bij de bewegingen om kwaliteit, uitgevoerd met precisie en controle in combinatie met de juiste ademhaling. Dit verbetert de kracht, balans en lenigheid van het lichaam; Juist d√©ze methode geeft heel snel resultaat.

NA,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

Als we dit goede eten verspillen, zijn de energie, uitstoot, water, grondstoffen en landgebruik dus ook allemaal voor niets geweest.

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

NA,NA,"[This activity is part of the programme for ""Tongues"" exhibition] Aurora de Nueva York en Soledad is a performance inspired by Federico Garc√≠a Lorca‚Äôs poems. Ainhoa and √Ålvaro transform these poems into songs and improvise with their material to expand their structure and meaning. What initially appears as a simple and innocent song gradually evolves and deconstructs into a profound auditory journey. Utilizing oboe, English horn, voice, and live electronic music, the performance integrates these elements seamlessly with images of Federico Garc√≠a Lorca's drawings. These drawings date back to his time in New York, where he was deeply affected by the city's harshness and dehumanisation. The performance combines music, singing, spoken word, and visuals to convey the artists' experience of language through Lorca's experience of living abroad. This performance goes hand-in-hand with the exhibition's theme, which brings together feelings of home/homelessness, language barriers, searching for a home, and the sense of self. During the Opening, our resident Vegan Bear Chef will offer a homey culinary experience inspired by traditional Italian family Sundays and memories of his beloved ""nonna Pina"" (grandma Pina): Take your spot on the shared table to try the toasted bread with tomatoes and fresh ricotta (starter), gnocchi with tomato sauce (main dish) and panna cotta with cherry coulis (dessert).

2 uren,NA,"Thema samentafel Tussen vrijheid en verantwoordelijkheid :  Morele reflectie over de handelingsruimte van de bestuurder en de (interne) adviseur Er is op dit moment veel te doen over het openlijke verzet van rijksambtenaren tegen het standpunt van het kabinet met betrekking tot de oorlog in Gaza. De ambtenaren hebben zich zelfs internationaal verenigd om te waarschuwen tegen het handelen van Westerse landen in dit conflict, waarbij de steun aan Isra√´l wordt gezien als bijdrage aan oorlogsmisdaden. De reactie van een aantal ministers is dat dit niet past bij de rol van ambtenaren. Zij dienen zich niet te bemoeien met politiek en zich te voegen naar het besluit van de minister. Er wordt verwezen naar de eed die ambtenaren hebben afgelegd, maar deze is het concrete geval op meerdere manieren te interpreteren. Over de eed die aan herformulering onderhevig is, schrijft de rijksoverheid zelf op haar website:¬† Ambtenaren moeten daarbij zorgvuldig belangen afwegen en hun bewindspersonen adviseren. Daarbij hoort ook tegenspreken als dat nodig is, bijvoorbeeld als beleid in de praktijk anders uitpakt dan de bedoeling is. Hoewel adviseurs binnen niet ambtelijke organisaties geen eed afleggen, gelden hier ook geschreven (gedragscode/geheimhoudingsverklaring) en ongeschreven regels. De interpretatie van de gewenste rol van een adviseur in een organisatie wisselt sterk in praktijk.  Uit de toeslagenaffaire hebben we¬† kunnen leren dat het luisteren naar kritische tegengeluiden vanuit adviseurs van belang is. Vaak worden kritische tegengeluiden onder het tapijt geveegd en ingekleurd als ongepast, niet passend bij de verantwoordelijkheid. Tegelijk is er ook iets te zeggen voor de ambtenaar/adviseur die in bepaalde mate neutraal/niet politiek is en zich richt op de vakinhoudelijke bijdrage. Maar waar moet die bijdrage uit bestaan en wat defini√´ren we dan als vakinhoud? En aan welk systeem lever jij een bijdrage en waar leidt dat toe? Als adviseur kan je je gevangen gaan voelen binnen het systeem waarbinnen je werkt. Welke grenzen van het systeem zie jij of zoek je op? Hoe verhoudt jij je ten opzichte van je bestuur en diens verantwoordelijkheid? Hoe vrij kan jij je voelen en welke verantwoordelijkheid draag jij met je mee? Dit zijn de vragen waar we deze samentafel bij stil staan. We nodigen jou uit je ervaringen in te brengen, zowel als bestuurder, toezichthouder, als adviseur of ambtenaar, zonder oordeel over goed of fout.  Het gesprek wordt begeleid door Hedwig Kauffman, stroomversneller bij desamentafel, bestuurssecretaris en gespreksleider moreel beraad.  In ons manifest van Zorg naar Leven pleiten wij als samentafel voor een verschuiving van zorg- naar leefwereld. Wij schrijven: ‚ÄòWij zetten ons in om deze verbinding te herstellen, omdat wij ervan overtuigd zijn dat zowel degene die zorg ontvangt, als degene die zorg biedt, zich beter voelen als ze elkaar echt kunnen zien voor wie ze zijn. Vanuit het besef dat slechts tijd en plaats bepalen wanneer wij zorg bieden, dan wel ontvangen.‚Äô Kortom, wij stellen het mens zijn voorop en plaatsen dit in een breder kader van een maatschappelijk samenleven. Wij verbinden dit met het bewustzijn van elkaars afhankelijkheid en tegelijk hechten we belang aan onafhankelijkheid, aan een democratie waarbij we de scheiding der machten nodig hebben, juist om ruimte te hebben om te handelen. Ook verbinden we de beweging die we bepleiten met de begrippen integriteit en kleur bekennen.

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

NA,NA,"In de eerste helft van 2024 start de workshopreeks Doelgericht Meten. Dit initiatief van Samen Meten in Zuid-Holland zal bestaan uit vier bijeenkomsten, die elk ingaan op verschillende onderdelen van het uitvoeren van een burgermeetinitiatief. Denk aan het opstarten van een project, het formuleren van een doel en meetvraag, het uitvoeren van data-analyse en het communiceren van resultaten naar de juiste ontvanger. Deze reeks richt zich specifiek op luchtkwaliteit. Bij succes kunnen we in een volgende reeks ook aandacht besteden aan andere thema‚Äôs, zoals geluid. Aanleiding In Zuid-Holland gebeurt veel op het gebied van bouwen en industrie. Het is daarom logisch dat burgers een vinger aan de pols willen houden. Zelf luchtkwaliteit meten is een interessante manier om dat te doen, en de provincie Zuid-Holland kent dan ook al meerdere burgermeetinitiatieven. Toch merken we dat de initiatieven in verschillende fases soms nog tegen vragen aanlopen. De workshopreeks Doelgericht Meten is bedoeld om samen op zoek te gaan naar antwoorden op deze vragen. Centraal hierin staat het delen en doorgeven van de ervaring en kennis van al actieve burgerwetenschappers en betrokken kennisinstellingen (bv. DCMR, RIVM). Samen onderzoeken we of meten een antwoord kan geven op jouw vraag of zorg, hoe je dit het beste aanpakt, en wat je er mee kan bereiken. Voor wie? De workshopreeks Doelgericht Meten is voor startende en al actieve betrokken burgers/ stadskenners/ burgerwetenschappers. Je mag deze uitnodiging natuurlijk delen onder collega‚Äôs of bekenden voor wie de reeks ook interessant kan zijn. 17 JANUARI - WORKSHOP 1 14 maart - WORKSHOP 2 - De Chocoladefabriek in Gouda WORKSHOP 3 (locatie en datum ntb) WORKSHOP 4 (locatie en datum ntb) Wil je graag aan deze workshop meedoen maar gaat het je niet lukken om naar de locatie te komen?

Een thema dat ons uitnodigt tot een diepere verbinding met onze omgeving, waarin mens, natuur en technologie zich ontwikkelen in wederkerigheid. Het programma van 2024 is opgebouwd aan de hand van vier perspectieven: 1#Verwondering, 2#Herontdekking, 3#Wederkerigheid en 4#Verweving. Op 14 maart organiseert de NVTL de eerste bijeenkomst #Verwondering bij De Kleine Aarde in Boxtel waar landschapsarchitect Paul Roncken (NatuurCollege) en Biomimicry architect Lydia Fraaije (Fraaij Architecten) het jaar inluiden met de vraag: ‚ÄòWat kunnen we leren van de cellulaire opbouw van de natuur voor het ontwerp van stad en landschap?‚Äô.

Paul Roncken BNT is directeur van het NatuurCollege. Opgeleid als landschapsarchitect en gepromoveerd op een hedendaagse interpretatie van de ervaring van het sublieme in het landschapsontwerp. Ruim 20 jaar verbonden aan Wageningen Universiteit bij de leerstoelgroep landschapsarchitectuur als docent en onderzoeker en tussen 2015 en 2023 in functie als Provinciaal Adviseur Ruimtelijke Kwaliteit (PARK) van de provincie Utrecht waar hij de provincie op verzoek of op eigen initiatief adviseert over trends en ruimtelijke ontwikkelingen in landelijk en stedelijk gebied. Vanuit zijn eigen ontwerppraktijk is hij als curator actief bij kunst in de openbare ruimte en het landschap. Hij publiceert regelmatig via artikelen, boeken en lezingen. Over Lydia FraaijeLydia Fraaije is een biomimicry en biophilic architect. In 2006 heeft ze haar architectenbureau FRAAi architecten opgericht. Als kind wilde ze dierenarts of architect worden en met biomimicry kan ze haar interesse en verwondering voor de natuur combineren met haar talent voor het maken van ruimtelijke ontwerpen. FRAAi architecten brengt Biomimicry en Biophilia in de praktijk. Hiermee wordt de basis gelegd voor een zacht activisme richting een duurzame en gezonde samenleving. Alle ontwerpen dienen te passen binnen de limieten en grenzen van ons ecosysteem en het doel is om met ruimtelijke ontwikkeling bij te dragen aan een gezonde omgeving die in balans is door het leveren van ecosysteemdiensten. Dit gedachtengoed komt voort uit het inheemse principe dat je de wereld beter achterlaat dan dat je hem gevonden hebt. En wordt versterkt door het toepassen van de patronen van biophilia. Hiermee wordt een diepe connectie gelegd met de natuur. En daarbij staat notie dat we zelf onderdeel van natuur zijn voorop. Over De Kleine Aarde, BoxtelDe Kleine Aarde in Boxtel was vanaf 1972 een proeftuin die pioniers de ruimte bood om te experimenteren met onder meer ecologische landbouw, duurzame energie en anders wonen. Vanaf 2023 komen opnieuw verschillende functies samen: een praktijkcentrum, cultuur- en inspiratiecentrum, debatcentrum, onderwijs- en onderzoekscentrum en innovatiecentrum. Het samenbrengen van verschillende functies, sectoren en actoren maakt deze Plaats tot een unieke plek. Op en rond De Kleine Aarde ontwikkelen we boerenprogramma‚Äôs en werken ze actief mee aan het opzetten van een regionaal lerend boerennetwerk. Daarnaast komen er op De Kleine Aarde onder meer programma‚Äôs rondom nieuwe economie. Verder zoeken ze uit hoe techniek en robotisering kunnen bijdragen aan volhoudbare extensivering en een natuur gedreven voedselproductie. Ze werken met kennis uit de praktijk maar nodigen ook kunstenaars uit voor een meer speculatieve blik op de toekomst.",0,24.79,EUR,NVTL,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-14T13:00:00Z,2024-03-14T17:00:00Z,NVTL Talks and tour: 1#Verwondering,Wat kunnen we leren van de cellulaire opbouw van de natuur voor het ontwerp van stad en landschap?,https://www.eventbrite.nl/e/tickets-nvtl-talks-and-tour-1verwondering-828263728107,amsterdam,NA

NA,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

In het tweeluik We need to talk about computing‚Ä¶ praten we over het geheugen van digitale cultuur, actuele thema‚Äôs van vandaag en mogelijke verbeeldingen van de toekomst. In deze tweede editie gaan kunsthistoricus, schrijver en curator Nina Knaack en het kunstenaasrsduo Driessens & Verstappen met elkaar in gesprek, onder begeleiding van ontwerper en mediakunstenaar Florian van Zandwijk.We need to talk about computingWe kunnen ons geen wereld zonder computers voorstellen. Digitale technologie is iets alledaags geworden. We werken er vrijwel allemaal dagelijks mee. Computers zijn zo alomtegenwoordig dat we nauwelijks nog kunnen overzien hoe ze werken en hoe wij ze gebruiken. Laat staan dat we ons nog afvragen of het anders zou kunnen. Dat was vroeger anders. ‚ÄúDe artistieke vragen van toen zijn de maatschappelijke vragen van nu,‚Äù stellen REBOOT-curatoren Sanneke Huisman en Klaas Kuitenbrouwer. Zij verbinden het pionierswerk van computerkunstenaars uit de periode 1960-2000 aan de maatschappelijke uitdagingen waar de verregaand gedigitaliseerde en genetwerkte samenleving van tegenwoordig mee wordt geconfronteerd. De opzet van deze twee avonden in het publieksprogramma bij de tentoonstelling is gericht op uitwisseling tussen mensen met verschillende achtergronden en uit verschillende generaties. Gevestigde en aanstormende ontwerpers, kunstenaars, architecten en andere experts putten uit het geheugen van de digitale cultuur om de koers van het vakgebied te verkennen. Met hun nieuwsgierigheid, verbeelding en vindingrijkheid anticipeerden de kunstenaars die in REBOOT te zien zijn op een ‚Äòtechno-politieke‚Äô werkelijkheid waar ze destijds nog decennia van waren verwijderd. Ze hebben die wereld bewust of onbewust mede vormgegeven. Wanneer je stilstaat bij de keuzes die zij toen gemaakt hebben, begrijp je beter voor welke keuzes wij nu worden gesteld. De samenwerking tussen mens en machine en de esthetiek van de computer Op 14 maart gaat het gesprek over de manieren waarop mensen met machines samenwerken en over de vraag of computers en programma‚Äôs ‚Äòeen oog voor kunst‚Äô hebben. Hoeveel vertrouwen stellen mensen in hun eigen kwaliteiten, in die van elkaar en in de capaciteiten van de technologie? Is dat terecht?

3 hours,NA,"Dit Bakkie Impact doet wat het zegt. Samenwerken voor meer impact. Zo werken we dit Bakkie Impact samen met een aantal Impactvolle partners zoals Rikx, Social Enterprise NL, Everyday Heroes en MKB Rijnmond om kennis te delen over wat waardevolle samenwerkingen met andere partijen, overheid of misschien zelfs concurrenten kan opleveren. Everyday HeroesSamen een arbeidsmarkt creeren waarin iedereen die w√≠l en k√°n werken, ook daadwerkelijk de kans krijgt om mee te doen. Als mede-oprichter van Stichting Everyday Heroes (www.everydayheroes.com) is dat waar Niels Agterberg voor gaat. Everyday Heroes zorgt dat een praktisch obstakel - een rijbewijs om naar projectlocaties te gaan, een certificaat om een machine te bedienen, een fiets om te forensen, enzovoorts - nooit de reden kan zijn dat iemand niet werkt. In samenwerking met 1000+ bedrijven en 300+ overheidsinstanties helpt Everyday Heroes duizenden mensen verder. Over Niels: Oprichter van Everyday Heroes en Managing Partner van ACES International, een recruitmentbureau in IT, die zorgt voor een scherpe kijk op mens en werk, en hoe deze het beste bij elkaar worden gebracht. Social Enterprise NL heeft als missie Radicale Systeemverbetering. Dat doen ze door het verbinden en ondersteunen van sociaal ondernemers, zodat zij hun impact kunnen vergroten. En ‚Äòhet systeem‚Äô op de schop kunnen nemen! En precies op deze be√Ønvloeding en samenwerking met de overheid, van gemeente tot Den Haag, zet Social Enterprise NL zich in voor professionalisering en groei van sociale ondernemingen. Zo versterkt Social Enterprise NL het 'ecosysteem' en activeren zij o.a. door lobby de overheid voor meer stimulerend beleid. Aan kennis geen gebrek: Social Enterprise NL organiseert een breed scala aan kennisdeling. Van een Overheidscongres, Masterclasses onderhandelen, lobbyen en aanbesteden, tot een groeiprogramma omgaan met de gemeente. Over Jorien: Jorien is verantwoordelijk voor de #lobbyforimpact. Ze zet zich graag in voor een (perfecte) samenwerking tussen sociaal ondernemers en overheidsorganisaties. Vari√´rend van ondernemers in de buurt, tot beleidsbe√Ønvloeding in Den Haag. Rikx Meten - Rikx heeft een objectieve waarderingsmethodiek ontwikkeld die het werkelijke effect meet van een sociale onderneming op het leven van de persoon met een afstand tot de arbeidsmarkt, de duurzaamheid van die impact voor de persoon en ook de mate van afstandsoverbrugging tot werk. Monitoren - Daarnaast monitort Rikx de daadwerkelijke uitvoering van het impact project. Dus het is niet zo dat een sociale onderneming een zelf evaluatie doet en dat daar een sociale score uit komt. Er wordt een analyse gemaakt door vijf externe experts die wij die rol toevertrouwen vanuit verschillende kennisperspectieven, zoals een hoogleraar economie aan de Erasmus en een Rotterdamse sociale ondernemer. Door die analyse weet Rikx wat de impact is op het leven van een arbeidstalent en op onze mooie stad. Matchen - Rikx matcht investeerders zoals ondernemers met een maatschappelijk hart of met een social return opgave aan de sociale ondernemers. Zo worden zij samen impact makers. ‚ÄúLokale investeerders en sociale ondernemers zijn samen de impactmakers van de toekomst en Rikx borgt en bewaakt dat proces‚Äù. In afgelopen anderhalf jaar die Rikx inmiddels als stichting is gestart, heeft zijn reeds 403 arbeidstalenten geholpen door 91 investeerders te matchen aan 14 lokale impactmakers die voor 568.978,- euro duurzaam impact op mens en stad maken. Over Betty Willemsen Betty is de laatste jaren actief geweest als directeur/bestuurder in werkgeversdienstverlening en van bibliotheken. Ze was daarvoor partner in consultancy en heeft vanuit die hoedanigheid ook aan de wieg gestaan van de ontwikkeling en implementatie van SR in Den Haag. Betty is bijzonder adept met SR en is positief over de relatie met SR in Rotterdam. Betty is van plan om van Rikx een duurzaam en waardevol instrument voor het impact ecosysteem van Rijnmond te maken die bedrijven gegarandeerd en gecontroleerd impact biedt middels de unieke methodiek van Rikx. In april 2023 werd zij door de koning verheven tot Officier in de Orde van Oranje Nassau op voordracht van Burgemeester Aboutaleb. MKB Rijnmond MKB Rijnmond heeft dit kwartaal als thema Maatschappelijk verantwoord ondernemen. Behalve dat de bijdrage van MKB Rijnmond erg leuk is, gaan we over de inhoud nog even niets zeggen :) Hogeschool Utrecht - Kenniscentrum Sociale InnovatieHoe kunnen sociale ondernemingen en reguliere ondernemingen elkaar versterken om de maatschappelijke uitdaging voor mensen met een (grote) afstand tot de arbeidsmarkt effectiever te adresseren? Dat is de centrale vraag binnen het onderzoek 'Meer impact door samenwerking' van het Kenniscentrum Sociale Innovatie van Hogeschool Utrecht. Tijdens Bakkie Impact zal Astrid Bolland meer over de resultaten van het onderzoek vertellen. Over Astrid BollandAstrid Bolland heeft een achtergrond in organisatie advieswerk en is sinds 2008 als onderzoeker en projectleider verbonden aan o.a. het Kenniscentra Sociale Innovatie.

NA,NA,Alexandrine TinneAlexandrine Tinne (1835-1869) is √©√©n van de meest markante vrouwen uit de Nederlandse geschiedenis. Haar leven leest als een avonturenroman en bestaat uit onverschrokken reizen naar gevaarlijke en -voor Westerse reizigers- onbekende gebieden in Afrika. Daarnaast fotografeerde ze in een tijd dat de fotografie n√®t was uitgevonden.

2 hours,NA,"Bad at Love is the working title of a project by Valentina Vella in its early stages of development. It's an intimate exploration of her personal struggles with love and relationships, but it also aims to be in dialogue with philosophers who write about the nature of relationships in neoliberal times. It also explores the role that intimate bonds can play in political movements and in the way we approach art. This event is not the presentation of a finished body of work but an opening up of the process when things are still murky and mysterious, with trepidation and warmth. An acknowledgment that every art practice is collaborative and shaped by our communities. It's like peeking inside a book that has just started to breathe, its words floating all around us. There will be performances, grounding exercises, conversations, and, if you're feeling it, the opportunity to do something together.What are your thoughts about love? We can talk about it at the event, but in the meantime everyone is welcome to contribute to this etherpad, using your name or anonymously: https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/Bad_at_Love. Here are some prompts, but feel free to ignore them:What do you associate with the word ""love"" (fee free to use an equivalent word in any other language)? What longings do you have? What are you afraid of? What are you angry about? What makes you feel loved? What's your favorite song about love or heartbreak? The etherpad will live on Valentina's website and will be used to shape and annotate the event, but will also play a role in the next stages of the project, which will include a novel that deals with love, solitude, communal life, and rising water levels. You can also write to her directly if you want to tell her something in a more private space: valvella@gmail.com with the participation of Luke Deane in the role of co-performer and Amy Gouwen (HumDrumPress) as wrangler kindly hosted by Marika Vandekraats Supported by CBK Rotterdam (Centre for Visual Arts Rotterdam)",0,0,USD,NA,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-14T18:30:00Z,2024-03-14T20:30:00Z,Bad at Love,a performance/workshop/conversation/open book about love,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bad-at-love-tickets-857160318587,amsterdam,NA

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

NA,NA,"Het jaarlijkse kennis- en netwerkevent van Architectuurcentrum Eindhoven in de Week van de Circulaire Economie vindt dit jaar plaats in Microstad... Sinds ons eerste netwerkevent in de Week van de Circulaire Economie, zeven jaar geleden, is er veel veranderd. Uiteenlopende circulaire initiatieven stapelen zich inmiddels op. Zo ondertekenden in het voorjaar van 2023 dertien woningcorporaties, die actief zijn in de Metropoolregio Eindhoven, een intentieverklaring om binnen vijf jaar 100% biobased isolatiemateriaal toe te passen in hun sociale huurwoningen. Een fundamentele prikkel om ook daadwerkelijk werk te maken van een reductie van de CO2-uitstoot in de bouw. Maar ook worden er steeds vaker bouwplannen gelanceerd waarbij circulariteit en de toepassingen van biobased materialen een grote rol spelen. Nu de regionale bouwwereld in beweging is gekomen, rijst ook de vraag: doen we wel genoeg? Wat kan beter? Waar lopen deze initiatieven tegenaan, welke hobbels zijn er te nemen? Is de geambieerde hoogstedelijke verdichting ook met biobased materialen te realiseren, en hoe ziet dat er dat uit? Wat betekent het aanbod van circulaire bouwsystemen voor de rol en impact van de architect? Het zijn slechts een paar vragen die momenteel spelen in de regio Eindhoven, een regio die zich voorbereidt op een duurzame toekomst. Ren√© Erven gaat hierover in op 14 maart in gesprek met Harold van de Ven (Building Balance), Ellen van Genechten (Hurks Da Vinci Green), Luuk Visser (Microstad) en met jullie: ontwerp-, ontwikkel en bouwprofessionals van deze regio.",0,0,EUR,Architectuurcentrum Eindhoven,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-14T15:00:00Z,2024-03-14T17:00:00Z,ACE-soci√´teit Microstad,Het jaarlijkse kennis- en netwerkevent van Architectuurcentrum Eindhoven in de Week van de Circulaire Economie...,https://www.eventbrite.nl/e/tickets-ace-societeit-microstad-841338364697,amsterdam,Sold out

NA,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

NA,NA,"Vanaf 1 januari 2017 kunnen mensen enkel nog beroep doen op de Vlaamse subsidie voor binnenisolatie als ze werken met een erkende aannemer voor binnenisolatie. De netwerkbeheerder (Eandis - Infrax) voorzien vanaf 2017 een subsidie voor de na-isolatie van buitenmuren via de binnenzijde. Deze opleiding en het Saint-Gobain Training Center van Gyproc¬Æ en Isover¬Æ zijn erkend door het VEA.
 
 Programma:
 De opleiding bestaat uit 2 lesdagen waarin de theorie wordt gekoppeld aan onze technische knowhow. Bovendien wordt dit verder toegelicht aan de hand van praktijkvoorbeelden door onze Gyproc-ISOVER-demonstrateurs.
 
 Tijdens de eerste dag van de opleiding worden een aantal basisprincipes van de bouwfysica uitgelegd. Daarna wordt er uitgelegd hoe de binnenisolatiesystemen zijn opgebouwd. Vervolgens komt de inspectie en de analyse van de te isoleren muur en de detaillering aan bod.
 
 meer info: https://www.energiesparen.be/binnenisolatie/aannemers
 
 Examen:
 Op het einde van de 2e opleidingsdag legt u een schriftelijk examen af om het certificaat te behalen. Om te slagen moet u minstens 60% halen. U kan het examen 1 keer opnieuw afleggen. U kan maximaal 2 keer deelnemen aan het examen voordat u de opleiding opnieuw volledig moet volgen.
 
 Certificaat:
 De aannemer moet reeds beschikken over 1 maand relevante beroepservaring. Hiervoor moet hij een ondertekende verklaring op eer bezorgen aan het opleidingscentrum. Indien hij dit niet heeft, kan er geen certificaat afgeleverd worden.
 
 Alleen aannemers die een erkende opleiding volgen √©n slagen voor het examen kunnen een certificaat behalen. Dit slaat op de naam van een persoon en wordt dus niet aan een bedrijf toegekend. Het certificaat blijft 7 jaar geldig en kan nadien via bijscholing verlengd worden.
