Brett. Humanity thought the war with demonkind was over. Now, after less than a generation to rebuild, the demon corelings have returned with a vengeance. The Spear of Ala—the fortress that stands at the gates of the demon’s hive—is the last bastion against the horde, and reports say it may already have fallen. Olive Paper is expected to take the vanguard in the fight. Only an heir of Kaji can wield the artifact that opens the gates of the Spear of Ala, and as Ahmann Jardir’s child, Olive seems destined for a role as leader and savior. But Olive does not wish to follow in her father’s footsteps any more than she did her mother’s. Darin Bales was born with supernatural senses that he struggles to process, so much that even those who love him believe he can barely take care of himself. Yet to save his mother from the clutches of Alagai Ka, the demon king, Darin will brave anything to mount a rescue. Darin and Olive each strive to walk their own path but find themselves inextricably tied to the legacies of their parents and to a fated confrontation with the demon king and his new hatchling queen. If they fail, humanity may not survive.",5,25,GBP,Waterstones,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-13T19:00:00Z,2024-03-13T22:00:00Z,An evening with Peter V Brett - Glasgow Sauchiehall St,Join best selling author as he launches The Hidden Queen,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/an-evening-with-peter-v-brett-glasgow-sauchiehall-st-tickets-797216765807,glasgow,Sold out

Love Music Hate Racism (LMHR) uses the energy and vibrancy of the music scene to promote unity and celebrate diversity through education and events. Our message is simple, there is more that unites us than divides us; and nothing demonstrates this more than music. Whatever the genre, music is living testimony to the fact that cultures can and do mix. Music has the power to unite, to give strength and to effect positive social change. Racism, on the other hand, weakens us; it creates barriers and turns friends and neighbours against one another. Sadly, racism is on the rise in the UK and internationally. We believe that if we work together we can harness the power of music to stop this destructive force in its tracks.

 4. Free Zones
 
 Dubai homes over 20 free zones catering to various industrial sectors. Setting up a business in Dubai free Zones gives the foreign investor 100% ownership of their business. Along with they enjoy benefits of no tax and other facilities in these free zones.
 
 5. Physical Infrastructure.
 
 Dubai is known for its world-class infrastructure. It has the best road networks, airports, ports and telecommunication facilities. Further, Dubai is heavily investing to develop better infrastructure facilities making it an attractive destination for investors.

Part of Fife Food and Drink Week. Gael's bio After beginning working life in live music events (Oasis, Prince, U2, Paul Weller etc) and some years in Scottish Television’s development and distribution arm I took a career break to be a full-time mum. Finding myself at a loose end in the Middle East I entered the world of entrepreneurship and set up an Import/Export business and an interior design store GECKO. I’ve created house party settings for Omani Royalty and furnished the terrace at The British Ambassadors’ Residence for the Queen’s visit. After years of traveling far-flung shores and a mid-life slog through the world of University, like so many great ideas, Kin began as a hobby and became a passion. When I started with a single colony I had no idea that this cluster of bees and my painted hive was going to grow into an award-winning business with apiaries all around Dunfermline, West Fife and West Lothian and I certainly had no idea of the amazing connections around the world that bees would create for me. I adore bees and being a beekeeper and I think you can taste my enthusiasm and passion in every jar of Kin award-winning honey! PS Yes! I am really allergic to bee stings!

Similarly, the topics of Diversity and Equality of Opportunity will only be covered briefly. We concentrate on competency based interviewing skills in this training. This is sometimes described as behavioral, situational, or job related interviewing. Course Topics: Similar Circles – This icebreaker requires some listening and questioning and therefore provides a very relevant start to the training. The Selection Interview – We explain what a selection interview is with particular reference to competency based interviewing. The learners then participate in an activity to identify the benefits and drawbacks of this approach before looking at ways to overcome those drawbacks. Diversity and Equality of Opportunity – In this brief look at the topic Yare reminded of the importance of treating job candidates fairly. The PRICE structure – Learners are introduced to our PRICE structure. PRICE organization – In this activity learners consider 37 action cards that describe behaviors and techniques that may be used by interviewers. Their task is to fit these cards within the context of the PRICE structure. This will help them to develop a good understanding of PRICE and how they may be able to use it. Wrinkle Chaser – You conduct a short interview activity to demonstrate the difficulty of interviewing without adequate preparation. The Selection Process – Learners are reminded that interviews are a part of a selection process and do not normally stand alone Question Plans – Preparing a question plan is identified as key to good preparation. Participants are encouraged to use a structured approach supported by our Question Plan template. First Impressions – Learners take part in activities to help them consider both the importance of making the right first impressions on candidates and the danger that interviewers can be unduly influenced by their first impressions of interviewees. We also look at rapport building at the start of the interview. Traffic Lights – In this activity learners consider nine different question types and decide whether they should be used in interviews. Effective Listening – Learners identify barriers to effective listening and ways to overcome those barriers. The Close Phase – This provides advice on what to cover with the candidate at the end of the interview. The Evaluation Phase – Learners are encouraged to suspend judgement until the interview is over. They are then taken through an approach for evaluating and scoring the interview linked to their question plan. Interview Practice – Learners take part in two or three interview simulations. They act as interviewer once and then as an interviewee and/or observer. Each of these roles gives them a different perspective of interviewing and will help them to apply the principles covered in this programme when they conduct real selection interviews in the workplace.

1 hour,Contact the organiser to request a refund.,"Everything you know about capitalism is wrong. We are thoroughly looking forward to welcoming one of the fiercest economic thinkers of her generation, author, journalist, and political commentator, Grace Blakeley, to Edinburgh on Wednesday 13th March at 7pm to discuss her searingly explosive and timely takedown of ‘free market’ logic, as she charts a path forward based in hope, democracy, and liberation in her new highly anticipated book, Vulture Capitalism: Corporate Crimes, Backdoor Bailouts and the Death of Freedom.  Grace will be in conversation Co-Director of Future Economy Scotland, Laurie Macfarlane. Join Grace at the Nicholson Square Edinburgh as she talks about taking on the world's most powerful corporations by showing how the causes of our modern crisis are the intended result of our capitalist system. In Vulture Capitalism, Grace Blakeley explains that it’s not a broken system; it’s working exactly as planned. It can’t be fixed, instead it must be replaced. A polemic against the heroes of neoliberalism, and a primer on people-centred economics, Vulture Capitalism shows that as private interests have taken hold, states and corporations have shifted away from competition and democracy, towards a planned economic system that works for the few – not the many. From Amazon to Boeing, Henry Ford to Richard Nixon, Blakeley looks at the past and present of our current crises to pinpoint exactly where it all went wrong. This is the book you need to understand what is happening in the world around you – and what we can do to change it. Grace Blakeley, is an author, journalist, and political commentator. She attended University of Oxford where she graduated with a first-class honours degree in philosophy, economics, and politics. She has written for the Guardian, Tribune and the New Statesman among others, and appears regularly on television and radio, including on ITV Good Morning Britain, TalkTV and Jeremy Vine on Channel Five.

NA,Contact the organizer to request a refund.,"Reiki is a special way of natural healing. It can help you rebalance to your natural state of wellness. The healer channels natural energy through her heart to her hands and connects this energy to you. Each session lasts for around 1 hour. We start with a calm chat about your health concerns. You lie peacefully (fully clothed) while the healer lays her hands - either hovering or touching - on the areas which need healing. Annabel adheres to the values of integrity, dignity and honesty and follows high professional standards. Reiki was first discovered in Japan. “Rei” means universal life force. “Ki” means the “chi” or life force we all have in our body. Sometimes the flow of “chi” in your body gets stuck due to emotional, mental and physical disturbances. Reiki helps to ease that flow. Reiki can be offered in-person and also by distance. For a distance healing the patient can be anywhere in the world, not in the same room as the healer. This happens at a high spiritual level. Annabel Allen brings a gracious reiki healing style to each patient. Annabel was trained in the Usui method of Reiki at the Shakti Healing Centre in Hong Kong and Lendrick Lodge in Scotland and is very grateful to her teachers. She first came across reiki as a patient when she felt a complete imbalance on all levels - physical, mental and emotional - during her divorce. She noticed the immediate effects - a pleasant gurgling internally as her energies shifted. She felt a release, a quiet relaxation and at the end of the session, stood up with renewed energy. After gaining profound healing over many sessions, she decided to train to become a reiki healer herself. Reiki is not a substitute for proper medical care. It is supportive healing and can be very effective as a supplement to necessary medical care. Reiki healing sessions with Annabel can be booked in advance. If the time you wish is not available here, please contact Annabel via the Eventbrite messaging system. Once your time is confirmed, she will set up a separate booking on Eventbrite. The healing sessions are held at Blue Morpho on Broughton Street.

This option also helps us sustain the reduced priced option. With these three options, it is also completely OK to pick different payment options at each class. You get to choose exactly what you pay according to what you can genuinely afford. We only ask you that you do a little bit of self-reflection before choosing your price point. You may find yourself somewhere between price points and that is fine. You get to choose which price point fits most comfortably at any given time. Jo Bluett started Edinburgh Laughter Club in 2010 and then set up Laughter For Health in 2012 after discovering that laughter profoundly helped her to manage her own chronic health issues. Laughter for Jo became a daily tool to manage mood, reduce pain, build resilience and boost health and happiness which she then wanted to share with others. Jo ran Edinburgh Laughter Club for 10 years totally voluntarily to become one of the most successful laughter clubs in the UK (the first club to run weekly sessions and the first to secure funding from the NHS). Together with her regular members, they raised over £25K for local charities - doing good and feeling good! There is ramped access into the building. The event will be held on the ground floor of Duncan Place Community Hub and is wheelchair accessible. There are two individual toilets on the ground floor with one being wheelchair accessible.

 At DOBA Studio, we offer workshops that focus on the importance of recycling plastic waste and turning it into beautiful pieces of art. Our artistic workspace specializes in using a combination of three portable and easy-to-use machines - a shredder, injection machine, and extruder - to create unique and eye-catching pieces that raise awareness about environmental issues. Our workshops are designed for all skill levels, from beginners to experienced artists. You'll get to work with recycled plastic waste collected from the local community, giving you a hands-on experience in upcycling. Not only will you have the opportunity to create something beautiful, but you'll also be making a positive impact on the planet by reducing plastic pollution.
 
 During the workshop, you'll get to use all three machines and leave with a handmade souvenir of your choice. Whether it's a keychain turtle, hexagonal coaster, or soap dish, the possibilities are endless. Creativity is the limit! We believe that art can be both beautiful and sustainable. By taking part in our workshops, you'll not only learn a new skill, but also gain knowledge about the importance of sustainability in our daily lives. Plus, it's a fun and educational way to spend time with friends or family!
 
 Our workshops can take place in the Studio in St Margaret's House in Edinburgh or at a location of your choice, such as a school or church. The duration and number of participants can be adjusted individually, depending on the location. 
 As an experienced Scout leader and event creator, our founder is dedicated to spreading awareness about saving the planet from plastic pollution. We also offer custom workshops for groups, where you can create products with your logo on them.

Conference on 13th March 2024 at the Birnam Arts Centre, Birnam, Perthshire, Scotland, hosted by the Forest Policy Group, an independent forum which advocates for better forestry in Scotland. This Conference is for people who want to make the case for regenerative forestry in Scotland to come together to make change happen. Forest Policy Group, are an independent forum which advocates for better forestry in Scotland, for more woodland, and more diverse woodland which provides a wider range of benefits for people and nature. We are not alone and we believe it is time to bring together the minds and voices of everyone who sees a need for a more resilient forestry, diverse in ecology, purpose and ownership. We need to focus on quality as well as quantity. Beyond the policy calls for increased forest cover, there is a deep-seated desire to see good silviculture, growing quality timber and many other products, home to a thriving web of species and working with the many changes ahead of us. Many, often quieter voices, are already working on those approaches. By collaborating, we can build the vision, pace and scale. We will hear from some of those who have already shown how different forms of forestry can benefit communities, contribute to local economies and respond to the challenges of nature loss and climate change. With an eye on the next two years, when grant support and forestry policy will be open to change, we need you to join us and share your experience, ideas and energy for how we can take the case for a shared vision of better forestry to the policy and decision makers that can make the difference.

After all, it has been my life, while navigating my daughter’s mental wellness for the past decade. I’ve been in your shoes - longing to create change - and at the same time feeling at a complete loss of how to create change.

NO ONE has time to add more to their day. That’s why I teach you my tried-and-true shortcuts to restore peace. Millions of solutions exist, but I’m curating my lived experience and expertise into the top 3 practices to explore.  Reality: Change will only be created thru a lens of subtraction. Learning what can be removed, and no longer serves us, to allow space for positive change - this is what you need!

6 hours,NA,"We are delighted to invite you to join us as we prepare native oysters for restoration in the Dornoch Firth as part of the award-wining Dornoch Environmental Enhancement Project (DEEP). The oysters, collected by the team from a nursery facility in Scotland, will have undergone the first stages of the biosecurity process and we are inviting you to get involved in the final stages of this process. By getting involved you will gain practical training in the processes of biosecurity necessary for the movement of native oysters into a restoration site. This event is suitable for over 18’s only and not recommended for anyone with a shellfish allergy or repetitive strain injury - please see the important information at the end and get in touch if you have any questions. Where About biosecurity When moving a species between two geographically distinct environments, we have to prevent the spread of invasive non-native species and disease, this is referred to as biosecurity. The biosecurity protocol includes the screening and removal of any attached biota (plants and animals) which pose a contamination risk both at the collection site and at Heriot Watt University campus. Once checked and cleaned the oysters undergo surface sterilisation before being sorted and counted then placed into clean aquarium tanks where they remain before they can be released into the Dornoch Firth. IMPORTANT INFORMATION We will be working outside in potentially chilly conditions during the practical session, so please wear clothes which you are comfortable and warm in (jumpers, hats, gloves, scarfs etc.) and with the possibility of rain, please also bring waterproofs. Personal protective equipment will be provided such as aprons and work gloves, but please wear something comfortable which you don’t mind getting dirty. The process of removing attached animals from the oysters and cleaning them can involve repetitive movement and the possibility of working in unfavourable weather conditions so please be aware of this when signing up. We would not advise taking part in this activity if you have a shellfish allergy or a severe repetitive strain injury. On campus there are cafeteria and shop facilities if attendees wish to buy any refreshments.

2 hours 30 minutes,Contact the organiser to request a refund.,"Following seven sell-out events across Glasgow, Edinburgh and the Highlands, The Melting Pot is excited to announce we are coming to Dumfries & Galloway for a cross-sector networking event. Our aim? To help bridge communities to spark new connections and collaborations. For our hosts, Helen, Jess and Anna, community is their guiding light. They've experienced firsthand the power of community in offering advice, support, inspiration and celebration. Now, they're bringing this spirit to Dumfries & Galloway. In a world where it's easy to remain within our comfort zones, stepping out is where the magic happens. New people, new perspectives: these chance connections are our opportunity to spark ideas, solve challenges and innovate through the collision of perspectives. In our first Dumfries & Galloway event, we will explore what community means to us all. You'll hear from our speakers about their experiences with their communities, their journeys in life and work and the lessons they've learned along the way. Join us on the 13th March for your chance to gain new insights, develop connections, spark ideas and step out of our silo's. What to expect: Our Community Partners: Our speakers Sarah-Jane Burns, Head of Regional Engagement, CodeBase Sarah-Jane has worked in education, business and community roles with a focus on cross-collaboration and community building. Seeing the benefits and impact of community-building and collaboration when people from different sectors and industries come together to create new ideas and deliver impact is where Sarah-Jane gets the most joy. Within her current role at CodeBase, she is creating space for the tech community in Dumfries & Galloway to come together, and having set up a business back in 2010, unknowing that it was a tech business and having no experience in this area, access to a community would have been a valuable mechanism for her success, and is what drives her ambition to make the tech community in the South of Scotland an accessible space for all regardless of background or knowledge. Sarah-Jane also spent 7 years working in the Scottish space sector, connecting business, academia and government around the uses and applications of space technology across sectors and was part of a team that helped build the Scottish space community and ecosystem. Sally Hinchcliffe, Cycling Dumfries Since helping found the Cycling Embassy of Great Britain in 2011, Sally has been a campaigner at UK, Scottish and local level for over a decade.

3 hours,NA,"Nowadays, data processing and model deployment are key problems for a company's data health. Efficient data processing guarantees ready-to-use data, the unlocking of new business scenarios, and, of course, the turning of data into business value. Correct data processing allows easy data versioning and governance, feature store creation and is a powerful real-time deployment tool. In addition, there are multiple possible MLOps strategies for model deployment. Many companies seek a real time model deployment strategy that can provide immediate answers for customers and will allow data to be analysed at business level. However, each deployment strategy has its own pros and cons, like infrastructural cost, deployment team effort, code and latency requirements. In this talk, Apache Beam will be shown as a possible solution for all these problems. Apache Beam is a powerful framework, designed for data processing and model inference. It offers a unified programming model which can define and execute data processing pipeline in an easy, flexible and scalable way. Core concepts and simple examples of Beam pipeline will be defined in addition to more complicated scenarios which deal with advanced features techniques such as windowing schemes for features creation. We’ll also take a deep dive into deploying and orchestrating pipelines on Google Cloud Dataflow (a fully managed service that supercharges Beam pipelines with unparallel scalability, and performance). Finally, we will explore how to deploy models on Apache Beam. Given the current hype on LLMs, we will see how to deploy quantized models in Apache Beam, relying on tensor-frameworks such as GGML, and how Dataflow allows an enhancement of Beam experience with advanced autoscaling and an efficient resource utilization and diagnostic. This talk will be a starting point for businesses that want to get the best out of their data with a simple approach, without relying on too many pieces of infrastructure to achieve data processing and model deployment.

It was a turning point in the way we understand and perceive the virtual worlds today. For the first time, the veracity of the reality was criticised, analysed and sometimes even annihilated. It is in this particular period that virtual realms were not only represented better, and understood more profoundly, but their existence and their fabrication, subsequently became an indispensable element of the reality itself. More precisely, the reality in this inconstant age became an increasingly fluid category accommodating different forms of the virtual and imaginary. In such a worldview that dream, illusion and vision carried equal importance as the palpable world of matter. About Professor Jelena Todorović Professor Jelena Todorović received her BA in the History of Art at the Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade. She completed her master’s (1998) and PhD (2004) at University College London where she also did her assistantship for five years. In 2005, she began teaching Early Modern Art History at the University of the Arts in Belgrade, where she currently works. Since 2006, she has been the head of a project that researches the State Art Collection in Belgrade, for which she received the European Union Award for cultural heritage in 2018 (Europa Nostra). She has published extensively on the subjects of early modern festival culture, concepts of space and time in the Baroque age, as well as the history of collecting and the history of Trieste in the 19th century. Recent publications include, The Concept of Fluidity in the Baroque Age: Liquid Mirrors (Cambridge Scholars Publishing: Newcastle upon Tyne, June 2023); 'Trust, Friendship and Politics in the Old Master Market: Duveen and the State Art Collection of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia', in Old Masters Worldwide: Markets, Movements and Museums 1789 to 1939, Edited by Susanna Avery Quash, Barbara Pezzini (Bloomsbury Press, 2022), 211-225; The Realms of Eternal Present – the Hidden Legacy of Baroque Culture in Modern Literature, (Cambridge Scholars Publishing: Newcastle upon Tyne, 2017).

Each artist explores the poetic arrangement of making through their various painting, drawing, collage and performance practices, which come together here to probe themes of perspective, vantage points and concealment. With sensitive observations of subject alongside a playful and charged handling of material and surface, the thirteen artists present their own sites for viewers to peer into. The motif of a window punctuates the show through elements of overlaid transparency, inner and outer landscapes and a framing of negative space. Layering, inverting, marking, enveloping its subject, ‘Arranging a Window’ explores the potency of the artist’s hand as an instrument for initiating new ways of seeing. It invites viewers to delve into these obscured windows and occupy the spaces they form.

1 hour 30 minutes,NA,"Abstract Digitization for Social Welfare: Examining the Building and Other Construction Workers' (BOCW) Welfare Funds in India Post-colonial nations such as India exhibit a variant of techno-nationalism, wherein technological prowess serves as a surrogate for self-sufficiency, fostering a sense of pride in the adoption of digital solutions for governance. Within this context, I delve into a case study where the techno-nationalist approach converges with the welfare entitlements of migrant construction workers situated on the peripheries of capitalist development. The welfare of construction workers in India is addressed through the Building and Other Construction Workers (BOCW) welfare boards, established specifically to mitigate the vulnerabilities faced by this demographic. These boards, operating at the regional or state level, boast unique administrative structures that have grappled with varying degrees of dysfunctionality over the years. However, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a notable acceleration in the digitization efforts of these boards, aimed at enhancing welfare delivery. Through examination of digital data sets and interviews with officials affiliated with these welfare boards, I explore the evolving landscape of digital welfare delivery in India. This inquiry provides valuable insights into both the opportunities and challenges arising from the convergence of the administrative state with digital technologies. Speaker Biography Dr Sruthi Herbert is a Digital Research Postdoctoral Fellow. She is also affiliated with the project ‘Reversing the Gaze’ at the Edinburgh Law School where she worked as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow. During this time, she studied the mutual interaction and constitution of the fiscal and the administrative state in India. She has a PhD in Development Studies from SOAS University of London that focused on people’s interface with India's developmental and administrative state and their differential experience of citizenship based on their social identities.

1 hour 15 minutes,NA,"We are excited to announce the upcoming session in Tarbert to gather valuable insights and contributions for the development of the Islands Connectivity Plan. Your input is crucial, and we invite you to be a part of shaping the future connectivity for Island and Peninsula communities. Structured Workshop Time: 18:00 -19:15 The workshop will feature small group discussions, each led by a facilitator from Transport Scotland. Participants will engage in 3 rounds of discussions, exploring key themes related to the Islands Connectivity Plan Strategic Approach and Vessels and Ports Plan. The 3 themes are: · Community voice and transparency. · Accessibility of ferries for people with disabilities or other impairments to travel. · Integration of ferries with onward and connecting travel. These are 3 of the key themes set out in the draft Strategic Approach paper and we are asking about all 11 of those themes through the public consultation. We would like to focus on these 3 themes in these workshops because there are gaps in our knowledge and understanding and we want to hear directly from people who use and rely on ferry services. There will be opportunity to raise points on other themes towards the end of the workshop. In addition, a drop-in session, providing an informal setting for community members to share their feedback and contributions on the Islands Connectivity Plan will be available for 30 minutes following the Structured Workshop. The Strategic Approach paper proposes our overall Strategic Approach to island transport connectivity including ferries, aviation, fixed links and, especially, addressing the strategic challenges facing the Northern Isles Ferry Services and the Clyde & Hebrides Ferry Services. The updated Vessels and Ports Plan provides detail on the Scottish Government’s objectives for the Northern Isles Ferry Services and the Clyde & Hebrides Ferry Services and which the Scottish Government is directly responsible for. It provides a long-term plan, to 2045, for the vessel and port investment considered necessary to address the key challenges of reliability and resilience.

Wait just as Bonnie Prince Charlie did for the 1000 local Clansmen to emerge over the hill, with their music of war. Ready to declare support for the young Prince. Unknowing of the defeat that awaited them in the Battle of Culloden.  Or catch a glimpse of the fantastic world of Harry Potter. Look through the Glen and the discover the Glenfinnan Viaduct, imagine upon it the Jacobite steam train. The wisps of smoke left behind as it takes the students back to Hogwarts. The beautiful Loch Shiel then becomes the Black Lake, beneath its waters an entirely new world of its own.  Are you ready to climb the Monuments winding steps? Emerge into the light onto a platform, 60ft above the shoreline. Taking in some of the very best views of the Scottish Highlands.

Several scientific studies have demonstrated the great benefits of breathwork: I have been guiding spiritual seekers for over 30 years with the self-transformative teachings of yoga, pranayama, transformational breathwork and meditation. During the last decades, I have been continuously updating my understanding of pranayama with the latest discoveries in sciences and contemporary breathwork techniques such as Wim Hof Breathing, Holotropic Breathwork and Transformational Breathwork. It is my pleasure and honor to guide you toward self-empowerment, transformation, and awakened consciousness. I will help you connect to your deepest self and inner guide, from the physical to the soul dimension.
