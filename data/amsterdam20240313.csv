Moderator Dounia Maakor zal in gesprek gaan met Sara Blanken (eigenaar van Mesure Amsterdam), Nina Hama (eigenaar van Hama Gallery) en de bezoekers over het ondernemen als vrouwen in de kunst en modewereld. Wat betekent het om een vrouwelijke ondernemer te zijn in een (voornamelijk) door mannen gedomineerde industrie? En waarom is vrouw zijn een terugkerend thema in (bijna) alles wat we cre√´eren? Met dit evenement cre√´ren we een ruimte om samen te komen, elkaar te ontmoeten en een open gesprek te voeren over dit onderwerp. Tijdens deze avond zullen de creaties van Mesure Amsterdam in combinatie met werken van vrouwelijke kunstenaars, vertegenwoordigd door Hama Gallery, te zien zijn in de galerie.

1 hour 30 minutes,Contact the organizer to request a refund.,"A space for everyone who is trying to adjust to the reality of mixed family environment. Are you or your spouse facing challenges coming with your (fairly) new family situation? Are you a step-parent, a parent with the child in a relationship? A blended family, also known as a stepfamily, is a family formed when two people come together and bring a child or children from previous relationships. When a blended family is formed, your children might be of the same age group or have major age differences, and you might also have a child together. As an adult, when you first re-partner, your relationship with your child‚Äôs other parent can go through a tricky time because they might be feeling angry, insecure, upset or worried about the change. You might need to adjust your co-parenting agreement to fit with your new family arrangements. Do you feel sometimes like creating a new family together is hard and requires a lot of work? Does it overwhelm you at times? Do you need to get something out of your chest and talk to other parents who are facing similar challenges? You are in the right space! Blended & Step Family Support Circle is a space for everyone who is trying to adjust to the reality of mixed family environment. This circle is there for people who are having a hard time and want better. It is meant for those who would like to exchange their experiences and meet others who are facing similar challenges. This is the space where we create a community and support each other through these times. One of the most common challenges you might be facing your step/blended family situation: It takes time to get used to living in a blended family. The early years in blended families are about getting used to the new family and building family relationships. It can also take time to establish your blended family‚Äôs boundaries and rules. This can be because the families coming together have different family rules and because everyone is still getting to know each other.

Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear.

You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials?

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

NA,Neem contact op met de organisator om een restitutie aan te vragen.,"Vinyasa yoga is een van de meest voorkomende yogastijlen en wordt ook wel Flow Yoga genoemd. Het is een dynamische vorm in combinatie met je ademhaling. Betekenis Je doet achter elkaar ‚Äòeen flow‚Äô aan yogahoudingen op de beweging van je ademhaling. De oefeningen vloeien als het ware in elkaar over. Vinyasa betekent dan ook letterlijk ‚Äòdingen in de juiste volgorde zetten‚Äô en ‚Äòverbinding van beweging en ademhaling‚Äô. Vinyasa yoga is een actieve vorm van yoga en valt daarom onder yang yoga. Vinyasa yoga stamt af van Ashtanga yoga. Waar Ashtanga yoga een vaste serie aan yogahoudingen kent en je hier niet van kan afwijken, is vinyasa yoga vrijer en er is meer ruimte voor creativiteit. Er is binnen deze yogastijl geen strikte volgorde die je moet volgen, waardoor de invulling elke keer anders is. De ene keer ligt de focus op je hele lichaam, de andere keer op armbalans en de andere keer weer op achteroverbuigingen. Maar de focus bij vinyasa yoga kan ook gebaseerd zijn op het moment van de dag of stand van de zon of de maan. ************************************************************************** Yoga, meditatieles, en Pilates doe je bij stichting !Triggr met een geldig abonnement.

NA,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

NA,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear.

You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7.

Your business competitors are not only working on stealing your customers away from you, they are also working on stealing your best employees from you. You are competing against other employers to attract and keep high quality employees. And your best employees? In this knowledge based economy, best employees know the key to their own long term well-being is their own skill set. They are hungry for knowledge, for wisdom, they want what's in your head, and they want you to make their learning experience inspirational not painful. If you refuse to teach them, if you are not effective at coaching, or if it's unpleasant to learn under you (you are a typical tyrant of a boss from 1950 LOL) they will quit and go somewhere else for the learning experience.

Welke slimme en solide basis is er nodig voor een betaalbare en toekomstbestendige gemeentelijke IT? üèôÔ∏èüí° üöÄ Slimme IT-samenwerking markt en overheid Het is voor de overheid om allerlei redenen soms lastig om slimme marktoplossingen te gebruiken. En tegelijk is het niet wenselijk dat de overheid afhankelijk is van de markt. Hoe kunnen ze elkaar beter vinden? üåêüíª üí° Tekort aan IT-personeel Er is flinke krapte aan IT-specialisten bij de overheid. En door de digitalisering neemt de behoefte alleen maar toe. Wat moet de overheid doen om voldoende technisch talent aan te trekken en te behouden? En hoe voorkomen we dat publieke organisaties met elkaar concurreren op de arbeidsmarkt? üöÄüë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª Jouw idee√´n worden gebruikt voor de volgende publicatie van de Staat van de Uitvoering van juni. In deze rapportage voor de Tweede Kamer signaleren landelijke uitvoeringsorganisaties en gemeenten knelpunten in de publieke dienstverlening en doen suggesties voor verbetering. Aan het einde van de dag presenteer je samen met jouw team in een korte pitch jullie idee voor een doorbraak. Een jury van sleutelfiguren reflecteert en denkt mee over de haalbaarheid en waarde van jullie idee. ü§ù Multidisciplinaire teams: Vorm een dreamteam van ongeveer 5 personen, met diverse achtergronden. We matchen je met het thema dat jou het meest aanspreekt! üöÄ Begeleiding door pro's: Ervaren procesbegeleiders van Hackathonopmaat sturen je door de dag heen. Check de sfeer van eerdere events hier: video 1, video 2, video 3 üìΩÔ∏è üçî Lekkere versnaperingen: Geen zorgen, we zorgen voor heerlijke lunch, drankjes en snacks.

Hoe overtuig je anderen van jouw idee of business plan. Hoe structureer en presenteer je je boodschap, zodat deze goed aansluit bij degene die je wilt overtuigen? En hoe ga je om met weerstand en kritische vragen? Het komt allemaal aan bod op vrijdag 8 maart 2024, van 10 tot 12 bij ZZIN in Den Haag.

Zij werken al 25 jaar samen aan de ontwikkeling van hun transformerende grootschalige werken voor het landschap, zoals Walk With Me en Signal. In hun werk maken ze gebruik van op maat gemaakte technologie, originele compositie en live performance.

De ruimtelijke opgaven van de locaties ‚Äôt Zoet en Schorsmolen (Breda) en de locaties in Waalwijk en Etten-Leur zijn ook exemplarisch voor andere dorpen en steden.

NA,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

Tijdens deze bijeenkomst willen we samen met beleidsmakers, het onderwijs en vertegenwoordigers van architectuureducatie verkennen wat architectuureducatie inhoudt √©n wat het nog meer kan zijn. Wat is er nodig om jongeren via architectuureducatie een stem te geven in de ruimtelijke opgaven? In Rotterdam alleen al zijn er een aantal toonaangevende initiatieven op het gebied van architectuureducatie. Kenniscentrum Cultuuronderwijs Rotterdam (KCR), gemeente Rotterdam, AIR, Metro010, Archiklas en IKBENWIJ hebben de handen in een geslagen om als coalitie samen te werken om architectuureducatie beter aan bod te laten komen. Op 13 maart zullen de vertegenwoordigers van architectuureducatie een korte pitch geven om inzicht te geven in hun inspanningen. Vervolgens gaan ze in een panelgesprek dieper in op de waarde van architectuureducatie. Na het panelgesprek gaan we in werktafelsessies uiteen en proberen we samen antwoord te geven op de vraag: wat kan architectuureducatie nog meer zijn? Het programma ziet er als volgt uit: Programma 15.30 ‚Äì 16.00 inloop 16.00 ‚Äì 16.05 start programma en welkom door moderator en initiatiefnemers KCR, AIR en gemeente Rotterdam 16.05 ‚Äì 16.15 pitches vormen architectuureducatie door Metro010, Archiklas, IKBENWIJ en AIR 16.15 ‚Äì 16.40 panelgesprek met Ellen Schindler (Metro010), Ma√´l Vanhelsuw√© (Archiklas), IKBENWIJ (Lorenzo Elstak) en Eva van Breugel (AIR) 16.45 ‚Äì 17.45 werktafelsessies 17.45 ‚Äì 18.00 terugkoppeling werktafelsessies en afsluiting door moderator en initiatiefnemers Locatie Independent School for the City Delftsestraat 33 3013 AE Rotterdam",0,0,EUR,"AIR, KCR & gemeente Rotterdam",https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-13T15:00:00Z,2024-03-13T17:00:00Z,Landelijke bijeenkomst architectuureducatie,Tijdens deze bijeenkomst verkennen we wat architectuureducatie is √©n wat het nog meer kan zijn.,https://www.eventbrite.nl/e/tickets-landelijke-bijeenkomst-architectuureducatie-807592229097,amsterdam,NA

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

NA,Contact the organizer to request a refund.,"Intro to Riso Join us for an in-person event where you can dive into the wonderful world of risograph printing. Whether you're a seasoned artist or just curious about this unique printing technique, you are more than welcome to join. We'll be gathering at Onomatopee on Lucas Gasselstraat 2A in Eindhoven to explore the magic of riso. This 4-hour workshop (10.00 - 14.00) is taught in English. We'll start with coffee and tea, an introduction to the history of the risograph, followed by a demo of the A3 risoprinter. There will be a lunch break after which everyone gets to print their designs. The workshop fee includes 15 prints in two colors of your own design in A3 (on our favorite off-white EOS paper at 90g thickness) and a list of resource links sent after the workshop. IMPORTANT NOTE! This course covers riso operational techniques, but not file preparation. Come to class with your file already prepared (you can read through the ""PREPARING YOUR FILES FOR RISO"" section on this website for more details: damnfineprint.com/pages/risograph-guidelines). When students use in-class time to finish their files, they typically do not have the time to get properly trained on our equipment. So make sure to bring two PDFs on USB :) Files should be A3-sized pdfs with a margin of 5 mm, set to grayscale, with a resolution of 300 DPI. Cost: total workshop fee is ‚Ç¨ 40,00.

Several scientific studies have demonstrated the great benefits of breathwork: I have been guiding spiritual seekers for over 30 years with the self-transformative teachings of yoga, pranayama, transformational breathwork and meditation. During the last decades, I have been continuously updating my understanding of pranayama with the latest discoveries in sciences and contemporary breathwork techniques such as Wim Hof Breathing, Holotropic Breathwork and Transformational Breathwork. It is my pleasure and honor to guide you toward self-empowerment, transformation, and awakened consciousness. I will help you connect to your deepest self and inner guide, from the physical to the soul dimension.

NA,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.
