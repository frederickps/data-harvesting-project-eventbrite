From understanding different tufting styles to hands-on practice, get ready to explore the fascinating realm where precision meets artistry. Why Tufting Matters: Beyond its historical significance, tufting has evolved into a dynamic craft that blends tradition with innovation. It's not just about creating textiles; it's about expressing creativity, adding warmth to spaces, and pushing the boundaries of design. Who Should Attend: Whether you're a seasoned textile professional, a DIY enthusiast, or someone simply curious about the world of tufting, this workshop is for you.
