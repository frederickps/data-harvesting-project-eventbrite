Here we have two practitioners with over 70 years of experience between them, who really understand their craft and care about getting the best outcome possible, and have put it all in writing to enable others. This event will be a chaired speakeasy in The Gallery with our two authors: Laura Alvarez and Rob Cowan. Their books will be available for purchase. Drinks and snacks will be available, as will, we hope, copies for sale of a special cartoon made just for the event. Plus, an opportunity to sign up for writing book reviews for the Urban Design Journal. Laura’s book introduces us to her 6 chosen tools, for creating a coherent place vision as well as an intelligible measurable quality assurance system that brings everyone on board, along with her much researched and recommended 15 Stage Urban Design Plan of Work. For 30 years Laura has constantly striven to evolve a clear methodical working system to access and record the unique character of locations, ensure public consultations happen in a genuine and meaningful way, and teams are enabled to identify and resolve problems at an early stage. Rob’s book starts with a brief introduction to some great pioneers behind the brightest ideas in urban design, and guides us through a comprehensive and well-illustrated overview of this multi-disciplinary challenge, arming the reader with the key information required for the understanding of the processes involved. Both have produced clearly written accessible and invaluable works enabling the urban designer to obtain all round engagement, collaborate effectively, and arrive at the best design solution for a coherent and confident public space. Amy Burbidge, Head of Master Design and Development at Homes England has diligently read both books, will chair the event Laura Alvarez will be interviewed about her book, ‘A Beginner’s Guide to Urban Design and Development.

Known as The Prince of Sophisticated Soul, his repertoire consists of signature interpretations of R&B classics like ""I Go Crazy"", ""Wishing On A Star"" and ""I Try"", with original hits ""A Million Ways"", ""Sorry I"" and the show-stopping duet with Rachelle Ferrell, ""Nothing Has Ever Felt Like This"". His distinctive baritone voice has resonated in the hearts of women world-wide and carved a unique niche in the music marketplace. With fresh melodies and lush arrangements that satisfy all musical palates, Downing continues to serve his fan base through his own Sophisticated Soul record label and sold out tour dates across the country. His latest release entitled “Pieces"" was released on February 10, 2023. He also hosts his weekly radio show The Wind Down which is aired on this site and over 20 stations around the world in the USA, UK, Japan, and Spain. Maysa  We knew and appreciated her even when we didn’t know it. Maysa lent her backing vocals to Stevie Wonder’s “Jungle Fever” soundtrack. We knew her as the best known and best loved of the rotating roster of super talented vocalists who helped create Incognito’s signature jazz/funk throughout the 1990s and into the 21 st Century. Maysa voice – sultry, jazzy and soulful – powered Incognito to international super stardom on a series of albums in the 1990s - “Tribes Vibes a Scribes,” “Positivity,” “100° and Rising,” “Beneath the Surface” and “No Time Like the Future.” Maysa seamlessly made the transition to a solo career that has yielded 14 highly acclaimed albums and sold-out live performances, cementing her reputation as one of the best artists working in the game today. Now as Maysa prepares to release her highly anticipated 14 th studio album – “Music For Your Soul” the public will see her in a different and fuller light. What’s different? Maysa adds the title of label executive to a resume that includes lead and backing vocalist, songwriter and producer. Maysa established Blue Velvet Soul in 2018 to exercise fuller control over all creative and commercial aspects of music making. “I wasn’t getting the kind of publicity or marketing backup for my albums that I thought I deserved, and I just thought if they are going to just throw my music out there, I might as well just throw it out there too and own it,” Maysa recalled. “That is what prompted me to start my own record label. I thought why not.” The learning curve was steep. Maysa knows every aspect of the production side – from songwriting to video production. However, she had a lot to learn about distribution and promotion. Fortunately, a mentor and longtime advisor helped her set up the label. The Blue Velvet Soul Records roll out began in 2018 when she released the songs “You Are Not Alone,” “It’s Gonna Be Alright,” “Loving You is Easy” and “Soft Words” as singles and then as a four song EP titled “The Fab First Four.” The carefully planned roll out of Blue Velvet Records will culminate with the release of “Music For Your Soul” early next year. Sporting 19 songs, “Music For Your Soul” is ambitious in scope. Maysa worked hard to get these 19 songs ‘in the can,’ and could have easily dropped a couple of EPs on various streaming platforms. That is what many people urged her to do. “My colleagues told me don’t do this,” Maysa recalled. “Don’t put 19 songs on the album because nobody has that kind of attention span anymore.” Maysa stood firm because her vision for “Music For Your Soul” is rooted in an idea that hearkens back to a time when music was more than a commodity. With Music “For Your Soul, Maysa” seeks to create an experience that will be the soundtrack for cleaning the house on a Saturday morning, musical sustenance for the long-haul trucker driving down a lonely highway or a mood creator for lovers spending a quiet evening together. “I am going to do full length albums for the rest of my career,” Maysa states. “I don’t want to do the EPs. I want to give people the experience that I had growing up. I loved my albums. I loved listening to both sides.”. While Maysa plans to release “Music For Your Soul” in early 2023, but she’s blessed fans by dropping three singles from the album this year. The single “Whatever” is climbing charts and filling dance floors on both sides of the Atlantic. Aimed directly at the steppers set, “Whatever” is a percolating, percussive, breezy, mid-tempo jam that finds Maysa seductively telling her love interest that she has a single-minded focus on making him happy. The simmering R&B ballad “Just Stay” finds Maysa taking a conversational but sultry tone that finds her dispensing with all pretenses as she asks her man to follow his heart and surrender to love. The Stevie Wonder ballad “Make Sure You’re Sure” holds a special place in Maysa’s heart. That tune appeared on the “Jungle Fever” soundtrack and Maysa served as a backing vocalist on that project. Maysa showcases her jazz chops on this tune as her torchy vocals and the piano engage in a dance. Maysa notes that she always loved the album and plays it frequently, However, her decision to record “Make Sure You’re Sure” and include the tune on her new album were deeply personal. “I went through a little bit of a heartbreak during the pandemic, and that song just jumped out at me, so when I was going through what I went through I decided that I would remake this song.” Maysa is crafting a masterpiece with “Music For Your Soul,” and the world will see that mas- tery when the album drops on March 31. In the meantime, Maysa released the latest single, “I Don’t Mind,” to commercial and critical",18.31,92.8,GBP,Soulgigs,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-11T19:00:00Z,2024-03-11T22:30:00Z,Will Downing & Maysa London,Will Downing and Maysa live together for the first time together in the UK,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/will-downing-maysa-london-tickets-649345127757,london

2 hours,Mobile eTicket,Contact the organiser to request a refund.,"As part of our Freud and Latin America exhibition programme, Belinda Mandelbaum and Stephen Frosh will discuss themes of colonialism and creativity in relation to psychoanalysis in Brazil. Drawing on work that comes out of their co-edited volume (with Rafael Alves Lima) Brazilian Psychosocial Histories of Psychoanalysis (Palgrave, 2021), Mandelbaum and Frosh will look to unpack the often-troubling histories of Brazilian psychoanalysis. Questions around the complicity of the psychoanalytic institutions with the civil-military dictatorship, the ‘anthropophagy’ (swallowing) of ‘European’ theoretical constructs, and a tendency to reproduce hierarchical systems of control during the dictatorship years, will be analysed alongside other more progressive psychoanalytic narratives that tell a story of the emergence of possibilities for creative expressions of freedom. By focussing on the place and function of psychoanalysis in Brazil, it becomes apparent how, in the words of this evening’s speakers, psychoanalysis as a discipline is susceptible, ‘to restrictions and/or opportunities allowed by the political contexts in which it develops’. This discussion will be chaired by the curator of the Freud and Latin America exhibition, Jamie Ruers.

Doors open at 6:30pm and lecture starts at 7pm The Last Tuesday Society invites you to join Matthew Levi Stevens on Monday 11th March 2024 for an exploration of the significance of Magic and the Occult in the Life & Work of the writer and counter-cultural icon, William S. Burroughs. “In the magical universe there are no coincidences and there are no accidents. Nothing happens unless someone wills it to happen. The dogma of science is that the will cannot possibly affect external forces, and I think that’s just ridiculous. It’s as bad as the church. My viewpoint is the exact contrary of the scientific viewpoint. I believe that if you run into somebody in the street it’s for a reason. Among primitive people they say that if someone was bitten by a snake he was murdered. I believe that.” – William S. Burroughs From the Introduction to The Magical Universe of William S. Burroughs:In talking about The Magical Universe of William S. Burroughs I am really thinking of two things:Firstly, and probably most obvious, is the material that appears in the output of Burroughs the Writer that can be seen as describing or referring to some magical, mystical or occult idea – Invocations of Elder Gods of Abominations, descriptions of Sex-Magick rituals, references to amulets, charms, ghosts, omens and spells – all the thematic set-dressing that we all know and love, from Hammer Horror Movies to Weird Tales, from H. P. Lovecraft to Dennis Wheatley and The X-Files…Secondly, there is the personal interest and involvement of Burroughs the Man with belief systems and practices that come from those strange ‘Other’ territories that lay outside the bounds of either conventional mainstream religion or scientific materialism – explorations of L. Ron Hubbard’s Scientology, Konstanin Raudive’s Electronic Voice Phenomena, Wilhelm Reich’s Orgone Accumulator; also partaking of the Vine-of-the-Soul with Amazonian shamans, attending the Rites of Pan in the Rif Mountains outside Morocco, participating in a Sweat-Lodge with Native American Indian medicine men – and, latterly, an engagement with that most Post-Modern of Occultisms, Chaos Magic.The material considered has been distilled from archival sources, correspondence, interviews, and of course, published works. As well as his own personal contact with Burroughs and his lifelong study of the Man and his Work, the author also draws from a wide range of former associates – collaborators, friends, lovers, and students – including C. J. Bradbury Robinson, Michael Butterworth, David Conway, Phil Hine, Graham Masterton, Malcolm Mc Neill, and others.As well as his own contact with the likes of Genesis P-Orridge, John Balance & Peter Christopherson of Coil, and writer Terry Wilson, back in 1980s London, he has also had unprecedented access to the papers of Cabell McLean, a young writer who was William’s companion, lover & student, c.1976-1983. Matthew Levi Stevens is a published author, occultural commentator, and Enochian & Hermetic magical practitioner. His published works include The Magical Universe of William S. Burroughs (Mandrake of Oxford, 2014), in collaboration with C. J. Bradbury Robinson, A Way With Words (WhollyBooks, 2013), and A Moving Target: Encounters with William Burroughs (Beat Scene Press, 2012.) ---------------------------- Devil's Botany is the UK's first absinthe distillery, founded by Directors of The Last Tuesday Society's Absinthe Parlour & Cocktail Bar.

It is hosted by Ugly Duck - an arts organisation that supports under-represented voices and emerging artists, on a bi-monthly basis. The project unfolds through ritual-workshops in accordance with the phases of the moon. It is curated by the main facilitator ByuKa (they/ them), as well as by invited guest queer magic practitioners. Some of the themes we explore are: Ways of queering and embodying the tarot Elemental magic Queer ancestor altars Rebirth rituals Shapeshifting techniques & How to create relationships to non-human familiars Frameworks for moon worship Ways of befriending grief B lood magic A strology T ranspersonal Psychology C haos Magick A lchemy The project unfolds through the lens of moon magic- an ancestral and animist ritual technology. This framework can help us reclaim our embodied cyclical rhythm of living, and guide us into how to honour both our phases of growth and celebration, as well as our grief, rest and reflection. Like the moon, we wax and wane. Instead of the linear, productivity-driven timelines of patriarchal capitalism, we devote ourselves to the creative flow woven by the magnificent planetary dance between the moon and the earth - which directs the seasonal changes, the movement of tides and our planet’s axis. As we are mammals who are birthed, fed and held between the cosmic and the earthly landscapes - we are made and unmade by these rhythms. Like the moon, we wax and wane. Empowering our lunar bodies can help us rebel against the industrial, machine-like clock that dominates our lives and our relationship to the ecosystems. Our lunar bodies can dream into being futurities that bloom with collective care, care that heals us from the violent spells of hierarchy, binaries and normativity. Futurities that are guided by myths & stories full of playfulness, solidarity, rest. Full of camp hybrids, sacred disruptors, wise fools. Full of recycled altars, ceremonial raves and sensuous technologies. The project also asks the question- what is queer magic? Lunarrr Playgroundz - both as a magical praxis & as an embodied mythology that is being collectively written- is inherently queer. Strange, fluid, playful. The moon is a shapeshifter. The moon transitions all the time- from one phase to the other, showing us its many faces, energies and qualities via an intricate dance of reflected sunlight, darkness, vulnerability and power. It’s a performative ceremony of many genders, many kinds of prayers, many pains and many sensualities - gifted to an entire galaxy.

About your host Liza spent the past 15 years working in the corporate world feeling stressed, constantly chasing my next deal and overwhelmed. About 6 years ago she started looking into alternative wellness and therapies because she felt it was time that she faced her trauma head-on and committed to healing. She came to understand that no amount of avoidance could alleviate the heavy feeling I carried within me. It was like carrying emotional baggage weighing her down. Amid my path of self-discovery and spiritual growth, she stumbled upon Breathwork, and it has profoundly changed her life. Early in 2022, she was appointed as Head of Well-being for the largest Education Recruitment Agency in the UK. I introduced breathwork and mindfulness across London and 9 regional offices and witnessing my ‘suited and booted’ colleagues embrace breathwork for stress and anxiety management was an incredibly fulfilling moment. Liza is now on a mission to empower others with the life-changing benefits of breathwork. This experience inspired her to create a conscious lifestyle brand, aiming to make breathwork accessible to as many businesses and people as possible. She trained in Neo Emotional Release and qualified as a Conscious Connected Breathwork Coach and Teacher under JP Crimi, a leading expert in the science and ancient wisdom of Breathwork. https://www.soulspace-studio.com/ https://www.instagram.com/soulspace.studio/ Waiver This style of breathwork is for over 18's only and Breathwork can result in intense physical and emotional release.

This workshop is open to total beginners and also to people who would like to develop their lino-printing skills. Over the two hours we have together, I'll take you through the lino-printing process from start to finish. We'll begin with a few warm-up drawing skills, leading into some linocutting techniques and a demonstration on how to transfer your design onto a lino-block. During the second part of the workshop, you'll learn how to carve your design and finally how to make a print! I'll be suggesting further printmaking techniques for those who have done lino-printing before; these will include making a reduction print and collagraphy. This session will be open for up to 8 people, thus providing a friendly atmosphere, where guidance and support can take place. The price will include a cocktail, all resources, plus you'll get to take your print and lino block home! I'm really looking forward to bringing a group of people together to make prints.

Food has to look good and I spend time designing its presentation. I realised that I had a talent for cooking when I was a teenager when friends invited me to their homes - not as a guest, but to cook for them! I am very proud of Afghan food.

As the days get longer and we leave the retreating energy of Winter behind, we welcome the energy of Spring to our kitchen. Once again, we find that what's inside our pots will be a mirror of what's going on outside in nature. Each meal is an opportunity to feed the body and soul, connecting ourselves with the Earth. In this series, our wholefood teachers draw inspiration from the Italian cuisine. At the heart of Italian cooking are three things: simple dishes, quality ingredients, and a whole lot of love. In this series, we will explore different methods of cooking that you can adapt to the weather - which tends to be quite changeable at this time of year here in the UK! We will work with a whole range of seasonal vegetables, and you will learn the fundamentals of each of these dishes - the 'why' and 'how' of combining ingredients.

1 hour 30 minutes,Mobile eTicket,No Refunds,"The practice focuses on kriyas, which are each a specific sequence of yogic techniques and meditations to create a specific result in consciousness. When energy moves freely through the chakras, it stimulates the mental, physical, and spiritual health of the being. There is a clarity that arises that combines perception, thought, and intuition. Benefits: A regular kundalini yoga practice also strengthens the nervous system and balances the glandular system, leading to increased emotional stability and physical vitality. Negative patterns and habits drop away, and creativity flourishes. About Christy: Christy is a Level 1 KRI-certified kundalini yoga teacher who trained with Amrit Nam Sarovar international kundalini yoga school in London and France. Christy discovered Kundalini during one of the most personally challenging points of her life, and finding the practice changed everything for her. Over the course of six years, she immersed herself in the teachings and techniques of Kundalini yoga, experiencing profound shifts in her physical, mental, and emotional well-being. ​ Inspired by the transformative power of Kundalini, Christy completed the Level 1 Teacher Training with Amrit Nam Sarovar in 2019 and began sharing the practice. She brings a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise in the practice, as well as a compassionate and supportive presence. Kundalini yoga is more than just a physical practice; it is a pathway to connection, healing, and spiritual growth. She believes that everyone can benefit from the practice and is committed to creating a safe and welcoming space. Classes are suitable for those who are new to yoga as well as those with experience in kundalini or other kinds of yoga, and everybody is equally welcome.

You will also develop many of the skills and techniques that will help you to use the structure effectively. Course Contents: The selection of new employees can be a long drawn out and expensive process. This means that we must do everything we can to ensure that when we do make a decision we choose the right person. Having gone through all the trouble of working through a selection process there is nothing worse than taking on a new employee who turns out to be unsuitable. A robust selection process will minimize the risk of this happening and, of course, effective interviewing needs to be part of that. If you handle selection interviewing in a logical, structured, and professional way the risk of choosing the wrong person is much smaller. This interview skills training concentrates on developing interview techniques. Although we will briefly touch on the laws of discrimination a detailed discussion of it is outside of the scope of this program. Similarly, the topics of Diversity and Equality of Opportunity will only be covered briefly. We concentrate on competency-based interviewing skills in this training. This is sometimes described as behavioral, situational, or job-related interviewing. Course Topics: Similar Circles – This icebreaker requires some listening and questioning and therefore provides a very relevant start to the training. The Selection Interview – We explain what a selection interview is with particular reference to competency-based interviewing. The learners then participate in an activity to identify the benefits and drawbacks of this approach before looking at ways to overcome those drawbacks. Diversity and Equality of Opportunity – In this brief look at the topic Yare reminded of the importance of treating job candidates fairly. The PRICE structure – Learners are introduced to our PRICE structure. PRICE organization – In this activity learners consider 37 action cards that describe behaviors and techniques that may be used by interviewers. Their task is to fit these cards within the context of the PRICE structure. This will help them to develop a good understanding of PRICE and how they may be able to use it. Wrinkle Chaser – You conduct a short interview activity to demonstrate the difficulty of interviewing without adequate preparation. The Selection Process – Learners are reminded that interviews are a part of a selection process and do not normally stand alone Question Plans – Preparing a question plan is identified as key to good preparation. Participants are encouraged to use a structured approach supported by our Question Plan template. First Impressions – Learners take part in activities to help them consider both the importance of making the right first impressions on candidates and the danger that interviewers can be unduly influenced by their first impressions of interviewees. We also look at rapport building at the start of the interview. Traffic Lights – In this activity learners consider nine different question types and decide whether they should be used in interviews. Effective Listening – Learners identify barriers to effective listening and ways to overcome those barriers. The Close Phase – This provides advice on what to cover with the candidate at the end of the interview. The Evaluation Phase – Learners are encouraged to suspend judgment until the interview is over. They are then taken through an approach for evaluating and scoring the interview linked to their question plan. Interview Practice – Learners take part in two or three interview simulations. They act as interviewer once and then as an interviewee and/or observer. Each of these roles gives them a different perspective on interviewing and will help them to apply the principles covered in this program when they conduct real selection interviews in the workplace. Course Feature: By the end of this Interview Skills training you will be able to: Public Speaking Training: According to a 1973 survey by the Sunday Times of London, 41% of people list public speaking as their biggest fear. Forget small spaces, darkness, and spiders, standing up in front of a crowd and talking is far more terrifying for most people. Through this workshop your participants will become more confident and relaxed in front of an audience which will translate into a successful speaking event. Leading Effective Teams Training: This training based on leading teams will help you to develop anyone that leads a team or is involved in a leadership role. It is also useful for those that are about to embark on a position of leadership or need to develop their leadership skills. Train the Trainer Training: Whether you are preparing to be a professional trainer, or you are someone who does a bit of training as a part of their job, you always want to be prepared. Your participants will understand that training is a process where skills, knowledge, and attitudes are applied in a unique way. Presentation Skills Training: In a survey carried out amongst experienced, middle and senior executives, designed to determine the things that they feared most, public speaking came out as number one. Death was eighth on the list! So, most of us would rather die than stand up and present! Practical Sales Skills Training: These practical sales skills training has been developed for salespeople or people who are required to sell as part of their role. This course is applicable for both people relatively new to sales as well as those who have a lot of experience as the content is flexible enough to adapt to suit the audience. Conflict Management Training: Disagreements, differences of opinion and conflicting perspectives on key issues inevitably arise in any context where people are working together. Research has shown that workplace conflicts can become highly destructive. Negative emotions may be stirred up, poisoning team morale, creating stress and destroying relationships. Power Query and Power Pivot for Excel Training: Power BI (including Power Query & Power Pivot) are the biggest Excel news items in the last 10 years. They give Excel users the power to draw information out of multiple sources, link it together then perform calculations on it that can then be sliced & diced any way you want. Essential Management Skills Training: Every day, managers solve difficult problems, turn organisations around, and achieve astonishing performance. To be successful, every organisation needs good managers. Manager Management  Training: With this course, you will be able to provide the skills, guidance, and empowerment to your team of managers. They will then be better suited in leading and motivating their team and thus produce fantastic results. To be a successful manager means having a wide range of skills. Through this workshop, you will be able to disperse your knowledge and experience throughout your leadership team. Sales Presentation Mastery Training: Sales are the absolute most essential component of any business, and selling skills are the most highly valued skills in today’s business landscape. The world's fastest growing and most successful businesses have one thing in common: they have effective sales people that drive their business forward. Time Management Virtual Live Training: Personal time management skills are essential for professional success in any workplace. Those able to successfully implement time management strategies are able to control their workload rather than spend each day in a frenzy of activity reacting to crisis after crisis - stress declines and personal productivity soars! These highly effective individuals are able to focus on the tasks with the greatest impact to them and their organization.

This concert features three student composer-performers selected from Cyborg Soloists’ 2024 Call for Student Projects: Art Banymandhub, Hannah Lam and Sophia Manta. They’ve created new works using innovative technologies including the ROLI LUMI Keys (a keyboard with pressure and surface sensors) and Showsync (software that creates live visuals that respond to the music). The concert also features a duo performance by Jack Frankland and Jonathan Packham (Cyborg Soloists Postdoctoral Research Assistant) featuring the Genki Wave motion sensor ring, as well as a performance by Cyborg Soloists Principal Investigator Zubin Kanga, featuring the piano, an analogue synthesizer and MiMU sensor gloves that can shape sounds through gesture and movement. This event is presented as part of the New Sounds Festival 2024, in partnership with Cyborg Soloists and the International Concert Series at Royal Holloway University of London. Art Banymandhub is a Mauritian born, British raised musician and composer. Growing up he struggled to express himself with words, finding instrumental music to be his primary form of expression. In his composition and performance work, ambient and solo instrumental styles have been his focal points, taking inspiration from composers such as William Basinski and Steve Lawson. This field has proven highly under-represented in his region. His passions in music are in creating works that allow audiences to deduce their own meanings from a shared stimulus. Hannah Lam is a composer and instrumentalist described as having a 'real and distinct compositional voice' by Bob Chilcott. Having studied composition and piano at the Junior Royal Academy of Music, Hannah is currently undertaking a joint degree in music and mathematics. She has been awarded the ORA Young Composers 2023 winner, along with being a finalist in the Young Percussion Composer of the Year, and selected for the LSO Next Generation Scheme. Her compositions have premiered at prestigious events such as the Cambridge Summer Festival and the Three Choirs Festival. Additionally, she has received compositional mentoring from composers; John Cooney, Gareth Moorcraft, Alexander Campkin and Dani Howard. Sophia Manta is a percussionist and composer. They previously attended the Junior Royal Academy of Music, studying percussion with Barnaby Archer and composition with John Cooney. Jack Frankland & Jonathan Packham are an improvisatory duo based in London. Zubin Kanga is a pianist, composer, and technologist. In 2020, Kanga was awarded a prestigious UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship to fund his latest multi-year project Cyborg Soloists, based at Royal Holloway, University of London, where he is Senior Lecturer in Musical Performance and Digital Arts. Cyborg Soloists has facilitated the creation of many new works exploring new interactions between live musicians and AI and machine learning, interactive visuals and VR, motion and biosensors, and new digital instruments. His Cyborg Soloists work was recently featured in The New York Times, The Wire, Classical Music Magazine, Limelight Magazine and New Scientist. Zubin has premiered more than 150 works and performed at many international festivals including the BBC Proms, Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival (UK) Melbourne Festival (Australia), Paris Autumn Festival (France), Klang Festival (Denmark), Modulus Festival (Canada) and November Music (Netherlands).

For this up-close and relaxed performance in the beautiful surroundings of our Herringham Room for music by Franz Schubert, Caroline Shaw, and Nathan James Dearden. Audience guests will also have the opportunity to meet and chat with the Tippett Quartet following their performance. This event is presented as part of the New Sounds Festival 2024, in partnership with the International Concert Series at Royal Holloway University of London. ‘The Tippett Quartet’s performances are little short of astonishing’ The Times The Tippett Quartet perform at Wigmore Hall, BBC Proms, Kings Place, Purcell Room, Queen Elizabeth Hall and Bridgewater Hall and broadcast on BBC Radio 3. They have toured Europe, Canada and Mexico. Their broad and diverse repertoire highlights the Tippett Quartet’s unique versatility. They have an impressive catalogue of recordings, most recently being awarded Gramophone Record of the Month for their recording of Gorécki Quartets for Naxos: ‘I cannot recommend this recording highly enough, and have run out of superlatives’ Gramophone The Tippett Quartet worked on a ground-breaking reimagining of Beethoven’s Op. 135 with composer/soundscape artist Matthew Herbert and have also given numerous world and UK premieres including newly discovered works by Tchaikovsky and Holst, as well as new works by John Adams, Freya Waley-Cohen, Howard Goodall and Alissa Firsova. They have also worked with Peter Maxwell-Davies for a performance of his 9th Quartet at the South Bank, with Anthony Payne on his Quartet No.1 for a live BBC broadcast from Spitalfields Festival, and Hugh Wood on his String Quartet No.3 at the Presteigne Festival. They have had the great pleasure of collaborating with inspirational soloists such as Kathryn Stott, Craig Ogden, Stephanie Gonley, Lawrence Power, Melvin Tan, Nick Van Bloss, Julian Bliss, Ashley Wass, Lynn Arnold, Emma Abbate, Mary Dullea and James Atkinson. They have also performed with the Royal Ballet at Covent Garden and have premiered a newly written film score for Alfred Hitchcock’s 1927 silent film classic ‘The Lodger’. In 2014 they started a collaboration with some of the UK’s finest Jazz musicians with the launch of their ‘Close To You’ project – a tribute to the album that Frank Sinatra made with the Hollywood String Quartet. In 2011 they celebrated the anniversary of the iconic film composer Bernard Herrmann with a series of concerts and radio broadcasts. They have worked with Damian Montagu and Hugh Bonneville for “In a South Downs Way” – a collection of poems set to music and can also be heard as featured artists on the film Knives Out & Glass Onion. The Tippett Quartet released a recording of the Penderecki Quartets for Naxos which was described as ‘life-enhancing’ by The Times and gained a 5* review in BBC Music Magazine. This was an extremely special disc having received a letter giving permission from Penderecki in January 2020 to record the 4th quartet, this recording in June 2020 was their first project after the COVID-19 lockdown.
