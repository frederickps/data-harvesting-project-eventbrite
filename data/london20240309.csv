Join Martin Kemp as he explores the evolution of iconic scientific images since the Renaissance, and how these images have come to represent entire fields of study. From the iconic double helix, to the famous E=mc², Martin will guide us through various images throughout all areas of science, the stories behind each image, and how they gained their revered status. He poses intriguing questions about engineering images depicting the unseen, such as the COVID-19 virus or the rings of Saturn. Discover the role of icons in scientific contexts and popular culture, as Martin sheds light on the common features that unite these powerful symbols by examining the prevalence of icons in specific scientific disciplines, as well as their significance in communication and perception. This talk promises to provide a deeper appreciation for the visual language of science, arguing them to consider the profound role that iconic images play in shaping our collective understanding of the world.

She yearns to find her inspiration and be amongst women who can support and elevate her."" We are so excited to bring to you the Women Who Dare to Desire conference in London for the second time, where you will have the chance to hear some of the most motivating and inspiring stories of women like you who fought for their desires and broke through fears and conditionings to reach for their dreams. It is time to celebrate these women and bring them all together in one stage, without looking at how well-known they are and how many followers they have, but simply looking and feeling their hearts. The conference focuses on inspiring you to connect to your deepest desires and motivate you to follow them. The whole day is an opportunity to uplift and honour each other, get inspired, create new projects, and network with other beautiful, like-minded women. You will dance, sing, honour your desires and collectively heal the wounds that stop you from following your dreams. And if you would like to share your story on stage, you can. How? You can have the chance to win one of the 6 x3 minutes speaking slots, which I will draw on the day when you buy a General Admission Ticket. Please select "" Women who dare General Admission with the chance to speak"" at checkout. But who am I? I am Debora, a passionate entrepreneur and mother of three gorgeous boys with a huge desire to inspire and motivate the world just like you. After receiving many "" no"" to appear on other people's stages and talking to many disappointed women who had the same experience and would tell me, "" Debora, this is just as it is"", I have decided to create a platform for any woman who has a passion and a desire to share their message with the world. I have immense trust in the universe, and I knew that this "" no"" I received differed from the others; I knew this "" no"" would inspire me to create my own stage to offer any woman who struggled to be heard. On Thursday, 4th of July 2019, the "" Women Who Dare to desire conference"" idea was born. The idea behind this project is to create a centre stage for women all over the world who have a story to share, who want to motivate and inspire others, even if nobody knows them yet, even if they have 0 followers, even if they have zero confidence to do it. 15 women will dare to speak their stories on the day, and many will brave the stage for the first time. Their remarkable stories will uplift you, elevate you and guide you to the possible next step in your life. During the day, we will have fun activities to help you connect to your INNER SELF at a deeper level, exercises to help you verbalise your DESIRES, express them, play with them and share them with other beautiful visionary women like you. There will be singing and dancing and beautiful performances. We will also go through a desire meditation and experience collective healing. I am so excited to have you there with us, either sharing the stage or simply taking part and shining your light. I believe in you! It is my biggest wish for you to start following your desires. It might start here, at this exact moment, with a decision to attend the conference. I look forward to meeting you, seeing you, hugging you ( I am a great hugger) and listening to you.

Join the TIL community in London for this exciting in-person event bringing together different voices and perspectives from across the endometriosis and women's health space during what we at TIL HQ are terming 'Women's Weekend' (International Women's Day on 8th, Conference on 9th, and Mother's Day on 10th!) Hear the latest advancements in research, treatment options and support for people affected by endometriosis and women's health conditions, and learn from leading experts including patient advocates, healthcare professionals, academic researchers, startup founders, and more. Together, we will ignite and elevate interest, investment, and innovation to make positive change a reality in endometriosis and women's health once and for all. Why For too long, endometriosis, and women's health, has not been taken seriously. Endometriosis affects 1 in 10 women and people who menstruate globally, a similar prevalence to diabetes, yet takes on average 7-10 years to get diagnosed. There is currently no cure, no true understanding of the cause, nor any forms of diagnosis available other than surgery. But there is hope. This Independent Life exists to help all people achieve health, wealth and fulfliment in life. From workplace talks, workshops and programs, to research, startup and government advisory, to community educational events, we help to bridge the silos, foster community and collaboration, and provide education, support and options to people with endometriosis and women's health conditions regardless of their background or where they're at on their journey. Future of Endometriosis will be a safe space for people with endometriosis and women's health conditions to learn, share, connect, ideate, and collaborate with others in the women's health space to leverage the power of community and create positive change for the future of endometriosis and women's health. Agenda & Speakers We have curated an agenda to bring you the latest and greatest in endometriosis and women's health. There'll be an exciting and informative mix of panel discussions and expert speakers, roundtable hackathons, networking, and free goodie bags worth £££ including products, discounted resources and options for support through our wonderful partners and sponsors. Please note for Zoom attendees joining virtually that we will start the meeting at 12:30pm GMT once all arrivals are completed.

Seth Newman: As the founder of the URUBU School of Transformational Arts and Ecstatic Dance London, he integrates the roots of Humanistic therapies, Bioenergetics & Body Psychotherapy, Transpersonal Psychology and Tantra in creative and life-transforming workshops, retreats and trainings. As a coach, Seth is dedicated to helping people calm, empower and rejuvenate their busy minds and bodies to achieve the best versions of themselves. Seth brings a wealth of experience holding heart-centered spaces. His in-depth studies, trainings,  personal experiences of many therapeutic modalities such as Humanistic & Body Psychotherapy, the Human Potential Movement, 5 Rhythms, Active meditations and the teaching of the Indian Mystic Osho who he grew up with in India in the 1970s,  infuse his approach to living a creative, holistic & embodied life and sharing his unique offerings with others. Seth has been facilitating regular workshops for many years.  As a musician, Seth is very passionate about rhythm & drumming,  has an MA in Community Music from Goldsmith College, worked as a world music percussion teacher in East London schools for almost 20 years, created URUBU collective back in 2009 as a Live Music Ecstatic Dance experience with Afro-Brazilian drummers & musicians and started his journey as an avid DJ with a love for Afro-Beat, Cuban and Brazilian music and created an Ecstatic Dance scene in London and the UK. Seth has a life-long passion for 5 Rhythms and other movement and Ecstatic Dance practices.  URUBU has since evolved into a School of Transformational Arts - offering a variety of powerful  holistic body-mind tools and practices.  MUSIC - MOVEMENT - COMMUNITY!  Brought to you by: Ecstatic Dance London - We love to dance. We love music. We love to inspire, to connect, to heal and transform!  Ecstatic Dance is a dance/movement practice to  explore the exhilarating feeling of moving your body freely. You are invited to move, play, connect, sweat, stretch, sound, unwind, renew, release, improvise, transform. Be true to yourself, while respecting your body, in this space that we co-create together. Move your body, unleash the wild dancing self without caring what people think, claim your freedom, open your heart & touch the infinite! Our Ecstatic Dance classes create a safe and respectful environment that embraces 'all ways'. We offer a movement practice that supports your free expression of emotions and inner space through movement and music. Our intention for these Ecstatic Dance classes is self-exploration, connection, fun, healing, expanding human potential and community building through freestyle ecstatic dance.  Enter an open space...and with your bare feet explore the exhilarating feeling of moving your body freely. You are invited to move, play, connect, sweat, stretch, sound, unwind, renew, release, improvise, transform. Be true to yourself, while respecting your body, in this space that we co-create together. PRACTICE SPECIFICS: Warm-up:  stretch, move/dance and reflect on the intention for the dance to a gentle sound wave. The Practice:  freestyle dancing to a large sound wave featuring Live DJ set. Some guidance & facilitation will be provided. And then we will let the music, the community and our own inner space direct our steps, our movements, our expression, our journey. Relaxation: Ecstatic Dance usually ends with a deep relaxation. No late comers please. This is a shared journey from the beginning to the end and we aim to create a safe container for all dancers.   1. No talking during the dance (if you wish to talk, you are welcome to chat before/after dance outside the main dance space). When we dance without the chitchat, something alchemical can happen on the dancefloor. A unified field of Being emerges and we feel both wild and free, contained within ourselves And connected to something much, much greater than our individual selves. 2. Drug-Free, Smoke-Free, Alcohol-Free environment 3. No photos or videos, Mobile phones muted and out of sight 4. Care/Awareness for the co-created space and each other 5. Move your body however you wish 6. No spectating. Stay connected to your own body, sensations, emotions, and feelings. Ecstatic Dance is about you and your relationship to the Dance. Dancers feel uncomfortable when being spectated at. Come prepared to Dance yourself free from inhibitions! 7. You can dance alone, or with as many partners as (you) like to join. (If you’d rather not dance with someone, thank them for the offer by placing your hands in prayer position at your heart – Namaste. Thank you, no thank you.) 8. This is not a pick up place. Please respect all dancers (especially women) and do not ask for anyone's contact details. If you wish to stay in touch with someone, give them your email instead of asking for their contact details. No means no.

The hosts and moderators have the right to use to their discretion to maintain order within the meeting by muting and expelling any participant or audience member without warning for not complying with the rules set out or causing disruptive behaviour. Privacy disclaimer: by participating in performance in this yaji, you in effect agree to being recorded or screen-shot, and to the recorded material and/or images being used by the Society to promote or advance its aims (for use outside this scope, the society will always ask for individual permissions before doing so or provide the reason in advance). If you disagree with this you must either tell us in advance so we can exclude you from any edited clips, or not actively participate in performing (esp. for livestreamed events where it is not possible to redact live footage), etc. Audience members not participating and who do not wish to be recorded/screenshot must turn their video and sound feed off and not use their actual name (it is their responsibility to do this as we cannot do these for them). If the ZOOM feed is to be recorded or livestreamed, this will be stated in the agenda or description of the event.

The jam is a chance for the Playback community in and around London (and further afield if you are happy to travel in!) to connect and play together. We intend to have 3 jams over the year. Future jams may include workshops if jammers want to share specific skills. Who? This is being co-organised by members of Trueheart Theatre and London Playback (Andy Yau, Ferran Luengo, Bel Sherlock, Simon Floodgate) and is open to anyone who has completed their Core Training (or equivalent) or who has been part of a playback company for at least 6 months. How much does it cost? We need to cover the cost of the jam venue, and so are requesting £8 contribution from each attendee. If we raise excess funds this time, those will go towards the costs of the next jam. What else do I need to know? Water bottles are allowed in the studio, but no other food or drink. So please come fed, and any snacks/drinks during the break will need to be consumed outside of the studio. For those who are able to, we can head to the local pub at 5pm for further socialising.

This is a year marked by dynamism, progress, growth, and positive change fueled by action and optimism. The Wood element encourages new ideas and ventures, and the Dragon thrives in groups, fostering teamwork and collaborations. Join us as we commemorate this potent year and seed our collective dreams into reality under the auspices of the New Moon in Pisces. About ĀKĀŚA ĀKĀŚA is a vibrant interdisciplinary community where exploration meets expansion. We curate enriching experiences at the crossroads of art, myth, nature, philosophy, and mindful practices. Fueled by the belief that our shared humanity holds profound potential, we yearn to cultivate connection, create healing spaces, and foster open dialogue. We long to remember the profound gift of connection that can never be fully experienced in isolation. Our experienced guides, drawing from ancient wisdom and modern practices like breathwork and yoga, support you in exploring your inner landscapes. By uncovering the wonder, joy, and deep connection within, we can co-create a more peaceful and loving world, together. Join us and embark on a journey to “Worlds beyond Words”. https://www.akasa.land ĀKĀŚA founders Lina and Maximilian are seasoned practitioners with 19 years of experience shared between them. Maximilian's passion for holistic healing began early, nurtured by his parents' involvement in the medical field. Eighteen months spent traversing Australia and Southeast Asia exposed him to diverse healing modalities, igniting a passion for holistic well-being. Upon returning to the UK, he embarked on a formal journey, acquiring expertise in Yoga, Personal Training, and Thai Yoga Massage. Maximilian's practice extends beyond these initial disciplines, seamlessly integrating Qi Gong, Breathwork, and Daoist Alchemical practices into his intuitive bodywork. This holistic approach fosters profound healing and transformation, tailored to each individual's unique needs. Beyond the physical realm, Maximilian is also a music producer. He bridges the digital and natural worlds, weaving together the power of synthesis with the organic beauty of live instruments and the human voice. These creations transcend mere music, evolving into healing soundscapes that resonate deeply with the body and soul. Descended from a lineage of healers, Lina carries a deep legacy of holistic well-being and root cause medicine. Her journey has led her to explore a tapestry of modalities, including naturopathy, functional and transformational breathwork, Daoist and Tantric alchemical practices, feminine embodiment, cranio-sacral therapy, shamanic healing, sound and voice activation, human design, and evolutionary astrology. This multifaceted approach allows her to understand the healing process from diverse perspectives, crafting bespoke pathways for individual transformation. Lina's approach blends ancient wisdom with the latest advancements in trauma-informed care and an embodied understanding of polyvagal theory. This ensures a holistic understanding of the nervous system's role in healing, creating a foundation for lasting transformation. With over a decade of personal exploration and experience, Lina guides individuals and groups on their healing journeys with unwavering support and deep compassion. She recognises the unique nature of each path and meets clients wherever they are, fostering a safe and empowering space for transformation.

This event will take place at Crucifix Lane, a serene location perfect for connecting with your inner self. In this workshop, we celebrate women by diving deep into the power of their intuition as we meditate and connect with our third eye. The Third Eye, or Ajna in Sankrit is a chakra located in the middle of the forehead between the eyebrows. It's associated with intuition, insight and it can take us to a place of higher consciousness and clarity. What to expect? Marianne, our instructor, will start the session by guiding you into a state of relaxation by activating the prana in order to free the mind and body, preparing them for union, harmony and balance. You will then move to a gentle yoga flow focusing on third eye activations via the asanas. We will focus on somatic movements to replenish your energy before transitioning into shavasana for a guided yoga Nidra (meditation). After that, we will gather in a circle for a guided meditation by chanting, singing and repeating affirmations together to activate the third eye chakra. We will then conclude the session by enjoying a cup of Goddess Eyes’ tea, a special homemade third-eye chakra blend made by Marianne. PLEASE ARRIVE 10 MINS BEFORE TO SETTLE IN FOR A PROMPT 2.30 PM START. Yoga mats and blankets will be provided at the venue. Please bring an Eye mask and a small pillow for comfort, if needed.

We will specifically focus on healing these relationships for ourselves through family constellations and ritual. We'll work on inclusion, acknowledgement, release and unentanglement of what we might be holding for the women, what wounds we are still living for them and what gratitude we owe them for our lives.  Everyone will take something out of this day in acknowledgement and celebration of Mother's Day and International Women's Day. A circle of maximum 15 people, connected by intention to work with our issues, to attend to family dynamics and to gain a new perspective on the real roots of what we are dealing with right now. We will have time for five constellations. We have a short interview with each issue holder about the presenting question/situation and then ask participants in the circle to represent relevant elements/people of the family system, revealing the hidden patterns, dynamics and loyalties that might be driving the issue. We will also do an ancestral meditation for the whole circle. We will have breaks for tea and lunch. Here you can book a representative place.

NA,Sold out,Contact the organiser to request a refund.,"Circling is a practice that allows us to slow down and explore this, to bring our attention to what happens in us when we relate with others. It invites us to make contact with all we are and to reveal this in our relating with each other. There is no goal or final destination and it’s partly this that allows us to experience deep states of connection and uncover long-forgotten parts of ourselves. Circling is often described as a relational meditation. It is built on numerous cutting-edge but simple techniques that support us in finding what is most true to us and communicating this powerfully and naturally. It widens our perspectives and our ability to receive and stay open to others. It nurtures a sense of deep personal and collective trust that is both relieving and generative. It gives us access to explore the golden palaces of our awareness. The workshop takes place in a cosy, clear geodesic dome on a rooftop in South East London, with a maximum of 12 participants. We will warm up with fundamental Circling exercises in 2s, 3s and 4s before coming together for group practices. These may include Birthday Circling, where the whole group gives their attention to one person for a period of time, Organic Circling, where we let our our attention move freely around the circle and Surrendered Leadership. No prior experience is necessary to take part. Teas and light snacks will be available and we will break for lunch. You are welcome to bring your own food or go out in the local area. Whilst this event suits those who have Circled before and newbies, the process can be emotionally rigorous. It is a daring practice that requires courage to meet what is within us, all that is within the other and to reveal this to each other. This workshop can be intense. People encounter places, states, emotions, beliefs, and sensations in themselves and others that are sometimes unfamiliar. We explore the unknown, the volatile, the ambiguous, as well as welcome emotions many deem as “negative” or “inappropriate” such as feelings of inadequacy, anger, sexuality, and joy. We refer to the willingness to feel difficult and uncomfortable truths as the “commitment to connection,” which of course includes a willingness to set appropriate boundaries and speak a desire for space, distance, and non-contact. By attending our events you take responsibility for choosing to leave the practice or participate in any given moment—which might include getting intimate with these kinds of experiences. We will often explore multiple sides of seeming opposites at once, such as independence and interdependence, chaos and order, and agreement and disagreement. We believe this can reveal an underlying unity of the immediacy of experience. If the above description of our workshops sounds potentially overwhelming or destabilising for you, if you have a mental illness or significant emotional challenges that you feel may be exacerbated by this type of transformational environment, or if you are not sure that you can be self-directed in taking care of your needs during the event, then we advise you not to enrol. ★★★★★ There is a brilliance in my emotional state that does not lend itself well to words, but without a doubt circling is a practice that I would not only recommend but encourage everyone to try. Katja - Designer ★★★★★ We started as total strangers and ended having seen something breathtaking in each other. It was a gentle journey that took us somewhere quite profound. Rich W - Marketing Strategist ★★★★★ I'm feeling really expansive and grounded in myself with a renewed sense of self respect. It's like my perception has been sharpened in a way that is exciting and hopeful. Sandra - Entrepreneur ★★★★★ I have a wonderful sense of calm that I have rarely experienced in life. My body feels supple and relaxed, like it’s been washed through. I am finding a new ability to observe the world and everything looks slightly different to how I thought. Oli - Finance Professional ★★★★★ I learned things about myself that I didn't know before. Feelings and emotions that were hidden or masked. I now feel better connected with myself and can already see improvements in the way I connect with others.

NA,Sold out,Contact the organiser to request a refund.,"In these workshops hosted by the MEMBRANES exhibition at Hypha Studios Stratford, you will learn how to make a cast of your hand or another object provided using alginate and cast it using wax combined with other materials. This workshop expands on the doctoral research of Dr Jennifer Crouch, whose research explores MRI through art. Using body casting we will learn about what a 'medical phantom' is and create our own through body casting (casting hands in particular!). A medical phantom or simply ‘phantom’ is a specially designed object that is scanned or imaged in the field of medical imaging to evaluate, analyse, and tune the performance of various imaging devices. Jennifer made some of these as part of their research Using alginate to make moulds of hands and various other objects like fruit and paper-weights, you will have the chance to incorporate a variety of familiar plant-based materials that can be used as 'tissue-mimicking materials' (TMMs).

Kaufman & Moss Hart Director Julia Locascio Performed by BA (Hons) Acting Musical Theatre Designed & produced by BA (Hons) Theatre Practice Placement MA Movement: Directing & Teaching Mary, Charley and Frank are aspiring artists in New York. Frank is a composer, Charley, a lyricist and playwright, and Mary, a novelist then theatre critic. They stride into their careers ready to change theatre - and the world - for the better.

After its failed 1981 premiere, Merrily is now running again on Broadway to ecstatic reviews.

Join us in community over two weekends at Berkeley Farm in Hainault to connect to the land and bring you the knowledge and hands on experience to design and create a forest garden.   Rakesh “Rootsman Rak” is an experienced permaculture and forest gardening designer and teacher. He will coordinate all participants to help make a real forest garden design for Berkeley Farm. You will learn his design tools, learning the many tools Rakesh has in his permaculture and forest gardening toolbox.   We are all too well aware of the challenges the world faces, especially in our food growing systems. This course shows us how to address many of these issues by making low maintenance, nutrient dense, biodiverse rich food growing systems know as food forests or forest gardening. We will also add many additional features to the design using Permaculture design.   So if you are interested in ecology; helping to increase biodiversity; sequester carbon; manage greenhouse gases; cool your surroundings while growing nutrient dense foods, soaps, medicines, crafting materials, etc but with minimum effort i.e. where nature does the work, and enriches itself, then this course is for you.   First Weekend: Designing forest gardens9th-10th March 2024, 9am-5pm   Imagine your garden or community space looking as lovely as a woodland edge. Imagine that on top of looking wonderfully wild, it produces an abundance of nutrient dense food and will ultimately need very little digging, weeding, manual watering or pest control - all in harmony with animals and other beings (eco friendly and vegan). This is ‘an edible forest garden’.   Forest gardening is a way of growing food where nature does most of the work for you. Modelled on natural woodland, crops are grown in different layers from high and medium sized canopy to roots, ground cover and climbers. And its not just food and medicine you will get from the forest garden, there are many more yields.   Through careful planning plants are chosen which have beneficial effects on each other, attract beneficial insects and create a healthy biodiverse rich system that maintains its own fertility. Once established, your main task will be harvesting! The course is designed so you will learn how to make a forest garden anywhere, including your own home, while also making a real design for Berkeley Farm.   Over the 2 days you will learn about the basics of designing a forest garden. You will get to understand- How to select the right plants for your environment- Where to place them to ensure they thrive- How to ensure you have the right nutrients cycling to ensure good crops- History of forest gardening- Why make a food forest- Layout of a forest garden- Multifunctional pathways- Creating abundance and resilience- Low maintenance food growing- Patterns in nature for forest gardens- Understanding and maximising edge You will put all of this into action by helping to design a real forest garden for the farm. Second Weekend: Permaculture Design16th-17th March 2024 9am-5pm   Over the 2 days you will learn about the basics of permaculture design. You will get to understand- Permaculture ethics and how to use them to make ethical choices- Permaculture principles and how to use them to strengthen designs- A design methodology to simplify and make designs easier and more robust- Water management strategies- Soil improvement strategies- Land management strategies- Low maintenance food growing systems   You will put all of this into action by helping to design a real forest garden for Berkeley Farm.   The course will be led by Rakesh “Rootsman Rak” - experienced Permaculture designer, teacher and Forest Garden specialist, yoga teacher and homeopath. He has been growing food since he was a child, and has been designing and teaching edible landscaping, permaculture, forest gardening, etc since 2009. Rakesh has designed and implemented forest gardens from small-scale private gardens and schools, to farms, community gardens, communal nature gardens, as well as helping design and implement forest gardens for various eco villages.   Location: Berkeley FarmManor Rd, Lambourne End,Romford, RM4 1NH,United Kingdom   Boots and appropriate clothing requested, bring your own lunch.

These are BYOB pottery evenings where I will show you some different hand-building techniques, and you will have free reign to make whatever ceramic pieces your heart desires! You’re welcome to bring whatever drinks you’d like, I will supply the cups :-) DETAILS ABOUT THE POTTERY EVENINGS: The groups are held in the Winchmore Hill studio every Saturday, from 6-8pm, with up to 8 people per group. Adults only! There will be alcohol present so no children please! Please note these are hand-building sessions, so won’t involve using a pottery wheel. We will be going through how to make a pinch pot, how to attach handles and how to decorate your pots with engraved drawings and carved patterns. Each attendee will have one pot glazed and be able to choose from a range of colours (with the option go glaze more pots at an additional cost). Pots will be bisque fired, glazed, fired again, and ready to collect around 2-3 weeks after the pottery evening. I will send out an email when they are ready to pick up, so you can come and bring them home! EACH 2 HOUR SESSION COSTS £40 PER PERSON (EXCLUDING EVENTBRITE BOOKING FEES), WHICH COVERS: 1 800g ball of terracotta clay All pieces fired All pieces glazed in 1 solid colour (not including pieces made with additionally bought clay) Guidance with hand-building techniques ADDITIONAL COSTS : multiple glaze colours - £6 glaze pattern / design / detailed colours - £12 extra 800g ball of clay - £4 each additional pot to be glazed - £4 DISCLAIMERS : Refunds will only be accepted a minimum of 7 days before the event, as I’m dependent on the income from these evenings, and am unable to find people to fill in for last-minute cancellations. I know things can’t always be predicted, so if you should be unable to attend within 7 days of the event, please let me know and I can supply an at-home pottery kit, where you will be able to make a pot at home, and bring it into the shop to be fired and glazed. Thank-you for understanding ! Firing and glazing can be very unpredictable, and there is no guarantee that your pots will survive two rounds in the kiln. While some breakages are minor and can be easily fixed, there is always the chance that with any air trapped inside, your pots could explode or break apart when fired. Luckily this has only happened to me a couple times before! But if it should happen to your pot, you are welcome to come to the shop + pick up another ball of clay for £4, which you can use to make another piece at home, and bring in to be fired.

It was the year 1830 when a young aboriginal from Tierra del Fuego was abducted and brought to England. As he was exchanged for a large pearl button, he was given the name of Jemmy Button. He was spared from being exhibited in a human zoo, as was the custom of the time; instead, he was sent to school to be indoctrinated in all aspects of English culture and the Christian religion. After some time, he was put on a boat and returned to his land – the famous voyage of the Beagle, with Charles Darwin on board – in the hope that he would spread “civilization” among the members of his community. The idea for this piece was born around a table in Buenos Aires as a way to answer the question: How is it possible to create a play that touches on the subject of national identities colliding with each other? What are the consequences, and what forms of dominance and resistance could emerge from that collision?",15,15,GBP,Calder Bookshop & Theatre,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-09T19:30:00Z,2024-03-09T21:00:00Z,The Trial of Jemmy Button,"A Verbatim play based on old documents and letters  telling the story of Jemmy Button, Darwin, FitzRoy and the journey of the  Beagle.",https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-trial-of-jemmy-button-tickets-662380526987,london

We live in a hectic world where women are expected to live and work like men. It is no wonder so many of us have menstrual cycles which are unbalanced and stressed, creating challenging physical, emotional and mental experiences. We all need an oasis of female well-being and restoration at some time in our hectic and busy life! This session is a gentle and relaxing hands-on healing sequence given by a trained Moon Mother who focuses the Divine Feminine energy used in the Worldwide Womb Blessing in a series of hand positions on the three main female energy centres (different to the chakra system) and on specific energy points on the female body that relate to the energies of the four female archetypes. The session will aid in: -Replenishing depleted archetypal energy centres so we feel whole and comfortable with all aspects of our self. -Helping to harmonise the flow from one archetype / phase to the next so we flow gracefully through the changes of our cyclic nature, whether in association with the menstrual cycle or the lunar cycle. -Energising the three main female energy centres, including the womb energy centre, bringing feelings of wholeness, stress relief and being centred, safe and empowered within our femininity again. -Clearing blocks that restrict our archetypal energies so that we live a richer version of our femininity, accessing the creativity, sexuality, intuition, clarity, wisdom and spirituality that lies in our authentic nature.

If you’ve come out of the correct one you should emerge straight out in front of the black Statue of Goddess Diana Water Fountain so stop there and ignore the rest of the instructions below.If you’ve exited the station at any other exit (there are several), you’ll either be on the north or south side of busy Piccadilly. You should see the trees of Green Park to the south, so enter the park to the LEFT< of the structure with the green roof (pics 4 & 5). If you find yourself taking tea at The Ritz, you’ve gone too far left!If you’ve entered the park via the gate (pic 5), walk along the path for about 70m and there will be a turning on the RIGHT> (pic 6), you should then see the fountain up ahead.Touch Continue when you can see it.The route you’re going to follow in the city is sprinkled with unique places, fun clues and challenges, and incredible stories. The experience will play out like you’re the main characters of a movie, only that you’re experiencing everything in first person! Fun dialogue, intrigue, and unexpected interactions are guaranteed. HOW IT WORKS❓ 1. Book your tickets 🎫 2. Download the Questo app - it's free 📲 3. Head to the starting point📍 The game is an interactive activity where you are guided by a mobile app through the city.

How would your Consciousness, Energy field, and Physical networks respond? Watch this YouTube video to see what people say about the Lucia No 3 Lucid Light Experience. ""A truly unique experience for each individual"" The Lucia No 3 - Lucid Light Experience creates a sense of deep relaxation, dissipating the sensation of time and space, with a unique experience to you. The combination of flickering LEDs and constant light stimulates the brains’ alpha waves and produces an optical experience which is entirely determined by the user's consciousness. Whilst sitting in front of the light, with eyes shut, the users’ mind automatically creates a series of images and perceptions, taking them on their own personal visual journey. Famous consciousness researchers' such as Tom Campbell (Physicist & Author of My Big Toe) & Anthony Peake (Author of Cheating the Ferryman, The Daemon, Is there Life after Death - and other titles exploring areas of human consciousness) have tried the Lucia No3 - Lucid Light Experience. Developed by Dr. Dirk Proeckl, a Neurologist and Psychologist, and Dr. Engelbert Winkler, a Psychologist and Psychotherapist, the kinetic light device stimulates neurotransmitters that facilitate harmonic patterns of the frequencies in different parts of the brain, which are usually only attainable after practicing meditation for many years. The Lucia No 3 - Lucid Light Experience can produce effortlessly and without long hours of practice: • Quick and sustained deep relaxation • The feeling of being outside one’s body • Spiritual or transcendental experiences • Being beyond time and space • “Deceleration” • Enhanced joy of living • Inner peace and emotional stability • Stress relief & Calmness • Increased learning aptitude and achievement potential • Enhancement of creativity We offer 3 booking options: 30 min sessions (£30) 60 min sessions (£50) and 90 min (£70) sessions throughout the day in London, Essex/East Herts & Cambridge .

This will make it easier for operators to invest in new technology. LoCITY also supports the introduction of new programmes and initiatives that aim to lower emissions and improve air quality. Course Modules LoCITY Driving is a seven-hour, DVSA approved course that focuses on minimising the environmental impact of heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) by reducing emissions through the use of fuel-efficient driving techniques, cleaner vehicles and alternative fuel technologies. Modules include: · Reducing commercial vehicle emissions · Using developing technology · Considering type of vehicles · Reviewing different types of fuels available · Impact of commercial vehicles on the environment Who should attend LoCITY Driving? LoCITY Driving is essential training for all HGV commercial drivers and will be applicable to all sectors. The training will raise awareness of the environmental impact of emissions, fuel efficiency, cleaner vehicles and alternative fuel technologies. Commercial drivers have a greater responsibility than other driving licence holders because they are employed to drive. They are required to drive professionally, responsibly and with consideration for the environment and other road users. The course equips drivers with knowledge of: · How vehicle checks and maintenance can help reduce emissions · Fuel-efficient driving techniques · The benefits of journey planning · How to use in-vehicle technology to improve driving performance · Alternative fuels in commercial vehicle fleetsAir quality and fuel efficiency · How vehicle checks and maintenance can help reduce emissions · Fuel-efficient driving techniques · The benefits of journey planning · How to use in-vehicle technology to improve driving performance · Alternative fuels in commercial vehicle fleets · Air quality and fuel efficiency Background to LoCITY Air pollution presents a major threat to public health, with transport accounting for 63 percent of nitrogen dioxide and 52 percent of Particulate Matter, the two principle pollutants of concern in London. Commercial vehicles represent around one-third of road transport NOx and PM emissions in the capital. The European Union (EU) has set legal limits for concentrations of these pollutants and they apply to the UK as a whole. London is one of several UK cities that are currently in breach of legal limits for NO2. In 2016, air pollution was found to cause the equivalent of 40,000 premature deaths per year across the country. In London, over 440 schools were in areas that exceeded safe air quality levels. It is vital that action is taken to reduce vehicle emissions and improve air quality. TfL is leading the way in reducing the environmental impact of commercial vehicles operating in London. It has worked with operators to develop the industry-led LoCITY programme.

Join us as we explore the events which during a few days in September 1666 left so much destruction, forcing Londoners to rebuild their lives. The City of London was used to fires, but the one that broke out in a bakery in the early hours of Sunday 2nd September 1666 was very different. By the time the fire had died down three-quarters of the city lay in ruins. Hear how the fire started and how it was able to take hold and create so much devastation so quickly. Hear who was blamed for the fire and find out about those who fought to save the city. Navigate the narrow streets of the City of London on this guided walk and hear how the Great Fire of London was the catalyst for modern building restrictions which changed the face of London forever. Hear stories of some of the people affected by this devastating event and how others took advantage of the situation. Discover what it was like to experience your hometown burning, never knowing if you would ever go home. What people have said about our Great Fire of London Walk: “Susan our guide was very informative and the walk extremely interesting . It was a cold day so as the walk is at a slow pace you need to wrap up well. I love these walks around London as even though I live in Earls Court generally i wouldn’t go wandering around the city etc and signing up to an organised stroll you find out so many things you didn’t know about the history of London. It really is a great City of the world” Meryl “The meeting place was easy to find and our guide, Susan was already there. After we were given our instructions we set off it flowed very well and Susan seemed to know where everyone was. As it was a Sunday the streets in the City were not busy. There were many stops where Susan explained the fire. We had two young boys on our walk who had studied the fire at school and she was very good with them, answering all their questions. It was a long walk which took time and a lot of the information may have been known to the walkers. All in all a good way to spend a couple of hours on a Sunday afternoon.” Peter “I took my children and they loved the great fire of London talk. They said that they had covered it before but they loved how interested and excited the host was and how much more detail she gave. Also they loved seeing all the places that they were learning about. It was a wonderful walk and we are already looking into the others that you offer!” Jessica",15,60,GBP,Susan Baker from London Guided Walks,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-04-03T10:00:00Z,2024-04-03T11:30:00Z,Great Fire of London Walking Tour,Discover the journey of destruction of the Great Fire in 1666.,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/great-fire-of-london-walking-tour-tickets-707056564217,london

NA,Sold out,No Refunds,"David Kirkaldy's Testing & Experimenting Works at 99 Southwark Street set the first international standards in materials testing; a science that has wide-reaching effects on everyday life today. Today, this unique Victorian workshop keeps alive our direct link with Kirkaldy's innovation, at the heart of this bustling commercial district of London. Kirkaldy's Testing Works preserves Kirkaldy's unique Universal Testing Machine - the huge hydraulic powered machine he designed and had built in Leeds - in full working order in the premises he built to house it. As well as presenting the story of the family who ran the business for almost 100 years and of the wider development of materials testing, the workshop and the Universal Testing Machine provide a unique crucible for new experimentation and collaboration - which can inspire future generations of scientists and artists alike to continue enquiring into the properties of the materials on which we build our lives. Your tour will include a 1-hour 30-minute tour around the Works (see the ticket options for the time slots available), including an introductory video and demonstrations of some of the smaller machines in our collection. We're now opening for timed entry (1-hour 30-minute tours with a maximum number of 10 visitors) through Eventbrite and are not accepting admissions at the door. Please arrive on time for your slot as we will not be able to admit you to a later timed entry. Make sure you've selected the right time slot when you buy your tickets. At this time, we are not offering Concessions tickets or refunds due to problems with our financial security caused by the lockdown. We hope that you understand our position as a small museum fully reliant on ticket sales. We're also now opening on some weekday evenings for shorter tours of the Museum. More info here. Even in these strange times, we hope you'll join us in celebrating the vision of a forgotten hero of engineering science. Find out more on our website here.

We will work with new modern styles, create from our own imaginations and also recreate Ancestral styles that harness the natural healing energies of crystals. As a result we will also become aware of what crystals are best to be used for any particular desire including balancing our own personal energy fields and even helping to maintain healthy blood which is good for those who suffer from conditions such as Sickle Cell and others similar in nature. At the end of each session each person will leave with a new piece of jewellery hand crafted by themselves and a bit more knowledgeable on the traditions of old. 'In the past years I have worked with Sickle Cell Cause in such areas as Sponsored Walks,						  Manning an Awareness Post at The North Middlesex Hospital,														 Fundraising and Spreading Awareness at The Notting Hill Carnival and on Public Transportation via leafleting, Visiting Parliament to discuss the importance of Sickle Cell Treatment in the U.K with M.Ps.		 Attending discussions with Palliative care stressing the importance of The George Marsh Centre to the Sickle Cell Community when under threat of losing it,  Supporting the group’s budget with personal donations of 10% of my business sales, and generally supporting those sufferers that I have come into contact with, with encouragement and any knowledge I have of aides/ contacts/remedies that may be of benefit to their individual needs. I have found this work (although hard to swallow when faced with such pain and suffering that one feels helpless to wipe away from their lives completely) Most satisfying when the results of our work bring about a real positive difference in people’s lives, unity amongst us and smiles to their faces'.

The cost of sequencing a genome has tumbled, DNA testing has become routine and new technologies such as CRISPR are allowing us to edit the code of life like never before. But the genetics revolution is only just getting started. Join six leading experts who will be your guide to the rapidly evolving field of genetics. Since the time of Watson and Crick we’ve learned so much about our genetic code – from reading which genes code for certain proteins to writing our own DNA code to create new microorganisms. NEW EVENT FORMAT FOR 2024 We are always seeking ways to make our events more inclusive and to find new ways to deliver value to you. For 2024 we have reduced the ticket prices and introduced a new ticket option “super early bird” for our Instant Expert events. All our Instant Expert events will be held at Conway Hall, 25 Red Lion Square, London. An Instant Expert ticket will no longer included refreshments or lunch, but the agenda includes a lunch break and there are many great eateries close to Conway Hall to choose from. But what doesn’t change is that each event will continue to feature six expert speakers sharing their knowledge and latest research on the event topic. We hope you like the changes we have made to the event format for 2024, and as always we welcome your feedback. At this Instant Expert, you’ll learn about: Talks and speakers: The Human Cell Atlas: Harnessing the Single Cell Biology Revolution Kerstin Meyer, Principal Staff Scientist, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute The human body is made up of approximately 37 trillion cells, which belong to different cell types that together form our organs. The Human Cell Atlas is an international consortium aiming to identify all these cell types, understand how they function in health, and find out how they become abnormal in disease. With the help of single cell biology, particularly single cell RNA sequencing, we can now study millions of cells simultaneously and use computational tools like machine learning to analyze the data we gather. By combining this extensive knowledge with spatial information, our goal is to create a comprehensive ""google maps"" of the human body. I will describe our work in identifying new cell types and states, as well as uncovering tissue structures that support organ function. In the future, we hope to utilise this knowledge to engineer ""designer cells"" and develop new approaches to treat disease. Epigenetics – Why DNA Is Not Your Destiny Nessa Carey, British biologist, Visiting Professor, Imperial College London DNA – it’s important, but in all except the simplest organisms it’s nowhere near sufficient as an explanation of biology. How can it be, when two genetically identical “things” can be so different from one another? Something else is at play, and that something is another layer of information called epigenetics. If you’ve ever been curious about why identical twins aren’t indistinguishable, or why the cells in our skin and kidneys are so different even though they use the same DNA code, or even why Californian condors can display virgin birth but humans can’t, epigenetics is the topic for you. Weeds: Nature’s ultimate survivors Dana MacGregor, Plant Molecular Geneticist, Rothamsted Research Even though weeds are arguably the most impactful group of plants, directly reducing crop yields and increase farming expenses, our knowledge about them lags far behind that of crops they affect. Weeds have been shaped by distinct natural and human-driven selection and they evolved have a suite of exceptional traits in response to and to circumvent those pressures. To explore 'weedy' traits, we're bringing these troublesome plants into the molecular laboratory and generating a molecular-level understanding of how they help weeds survive. Exciting breakthroughs, such as methods to temporarily control gene expression guided by fully sequenced and annotated genomes, have already been achieved. Join us for this presentation as we discuss these breakthroughs and explore how understanding the genetic and molecular aspects of agricultural weeds gained in the lab is crucial for developing effective and innovative solutions for tomorrow’s agriculture. New genetic findings from old bones Marina Silva, Postdoctoral Fellow, The Francis Crick Institute How can the remnants of ancient bodies help us decode the mysteries of our past? Join Dr Marina Silva, a Postdoctoral Fellow at The Francis Crick Institute, to discover how we are able to extract and decode ancient DNA in archaeological bone fragments. She will guide us through the cutting-edge techniques employed at the intersection of genomics, archaeology, and anthropology that uncover the untold stories of individuals who lived thousands of years ago. Francis Galton, eugenics and why we need new science stories Subhadra Das, Author, historian, broadcaster, and comedian Francis Galton is the most influential Victorian scientist most people have never heard of. If you have heard of him, you may know that his research fed into a wide range of sciences from meteorology to criminology, psychology, sociology and statistics. Through his work in mathematical biology in the last decades of the nineteenth century, Galton is widely held to be one of the godfathers of modern genetics. In 1883 Galton coined the word ‘eugenics’ to describe his vision for a society governed by scientific knowledge. In this talk, Subhadra Das, former curator of the Galton Collection at UCL, will describe the colonial and racist ideas that framed Galton’s work, and explain why, for her, the absence of Galton’s story in our popular science history discourse is a story in itself. Recent Advances in Genetic Manipulation – from the bench to bedside Antony Adamson, Senior Experimental Officer, University of Manchester How does CRISPR-Cas9 work? Why has it become the tool of choice for genetic manipulation? And how is it used on a daily basis? Join Antony Adamson from the University of Manchester as he explains the science behind this Nobel Prize-winning technique. Antony will also explore the future of gene editing, highlighting exciting developments in the clinical use of this technology to treat genetic disease, but also the drawbacks and ethical challenges that need to be addressed. Who should attend? Anyone interested in genetics, whatever your age or background.

NA,Sold out,Contact the organiser to request a refund.,"Curated by artist David Blandy and writer Jamie Sutcliffe in association with Strange Attractor Press, Areas Of Effect: Planar Systems, Critical Roles, and Gaming Imaginaries is a one-day symposium on Tabletop Role Playing Games (TTRPGs) with live game sessions. Forming part of arebyte’s programme The Body, The Mind, The Soul which questions the complex nature of humanity in the realm of technological progress, the event brings together artists, game designers, theorists, and philosophers to discuss these wildly expansive forms of play in which players utilise both their imaginations and chance mechanics (such as dice rolls) to determine the actions of fictional characters and the scenarios surrounding them. The symposium explores TTRPGs as physical interfaces between the body and the imaginary, and questions their myriad uses as transformative activities. Beyond leisure activities, might we think of these strange forms of play as novel opportunities for immersivity, problem solving, explorations of contingency, and perhaps most importantly, communal storytelling? Speakers at the event include acclaimed RPG designers Emmy Allan, Kayla Dice, Mike Mason, Chris McDowall, Samuel Mui, and Zedeck Siew, alongside writers, historians and theorists such as Stu Horvath, Timothy Linward, Mark Pilkington, and Simon O’Sullivan. An exhibition of TTRPGs-inspired video games by artists Kitty Clark, Uma Breakdown, John Powell-Jones, Petra Szemán, and Holly White are hosted on computers and available to play for visitors throughout the whole event. The day culminates in live TTRPG play sessions of the games ECOMOFOS!! by artist David Blandy and SUPERZEROES by TTRPG game designer Samuel Mui, amongst others, inviting the audience to play with a deck of uniquely designed TTRPG playing cards.

His work explores artistic encounters with science fictive fabulation, the politics of gaming, animation and its multiple entanglements with developments in the life sciences, haunted media, the digital uncanny, and the persistence of myth, all understood as technologies of selfhood. He is the editor of Documents of Contemporary Art: Magic, published by The Whitechapel Gallery and The MIT Press, and his essays, reviews, and interviews have been featured in Art Monthly, Frieze, The White Review, Rhizome, Art Review, The Quietus, Art Agenda, Bricks From The Kiln, and IsThisIt, amongst others. @intron_depot David Blandy (1976, UK, Lives & works in Brighton) makes work that slips between performance and video, digital and analogue, investigating the stories and cultural forces that inform and influence our lives. Collaboration is central to his practice, examining communal and personal heritage and interdependence. With research spanning multiple forms of archive, from fandoms to the archive of the body, historic texts to academic libraries, archaeology and ecological theory, twitch streams and film archives, Blandy weaves poetic works that explore the complexities of the contemporary subject. @david_blandy_ Event made in partnership with Strange Attractor Press.",8,12,GBP,arebyte,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-09T11:00:00Z,2024-03-09T20:30:00Z,"Areas Of Effect: Planar Systems, Critical Roles, and Gaming Imaginaries","TTRPG designers, writers and artists address the hopes currently instilled in Tabletop Role Playing Games as a transformative activity.",https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/areas-of-effect-planar-systems-critical-roles-and-gaming-imaginaries-tickets-677306159957,london

NA,Sold out,Contact the organiser to request a refund.,"Join us for the next Dazed x MUBI Cinema Club screening – a UK premiere of the documentary The Last Year of Darkness, which offers an unfiltered and authentic glimpse of queer youth in Chengdu, directed by Benjamin Mullinkosson. The event will include Q&A with the director himself in partnership with HOWL Worldwide, as well as an afterparty with DJ sets from Cosmic Caz and Nanzhen Yang. Titled The Last Year of Darkness, the film offers a portrait of life in the city – often regarded as a safe oasis for queer Chinese youth – as it undergoes cultural and economic changes that threaten the existence of its underground spaces. At the centre of this story is Funky Town, an underground club that represents a “haven for outsiders who live every weekend like it’s their last”, which is on the brink of closure due to the expansion of the city’s subway. Mullinkosson’s bass-heavy document of this condemned club scene follows young, queer clubbers, DJs, and performance artists through the drudgery and worries of their daytime lives, which are contrasted with the escapism of techno-soundtracked nights at Funky Town, until both worlds inevitably collide. The screening will be followed by an in-person Q&A with Mullinkosson. After the screening, HOWL Worldwide have curated a line-up of DJs to keep you dancing til late. Doors open at 8.15pm. All tickets will include a free welcome drink and popcorn. To book half-price tickets to all Dazed x MUBI Cinema Club screenings, join Dazed Club.

NA,Sold out,No Refunds,"Athens, a great political and cultural power in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, did not cease to be an important city during the Hellenistic period, despite the decrease in its importance due to new political and cultural centres. But what was its culinary place in the Hellenistic world? Evidence provided from archaeological material, literary sources and food remains reveal that, despite the strength of the conservative Athenian character, there were many changes and innovations, especially in food preparation and cooking techniques. In affluent houses the dining became more elaborate and sophisticated. Even the wine-soaked classical symposium changed; the focus moved from wine to complex banquets where food had a prominent role. The diet of the average, non-elite individual was quite simple whereas the poor ate the cheapest food available for sustenance. A lecture on food tradition and change in the cuisines of Hellenistic Athens will be followed by a dinner of foods that were served at the tables of the affluent and the poor. Participants will try dishes inspired by historical recipes and prepared according to experimental archaeology. You will receive a glimpse into Hellenistic Athenian cuisines and discover the taste of the past. What to expect: Our bar will open one hour before the event starts and remain open for one hour after the event finishes.

Contestants have progressed through their club and area contests and are just one contest away from the big District 91 finals. There will be a keynote speech by Robin Sundstrom, Toastmaster and Ted X Speaker, called; 'How Daily Vlogging Makes You A More Confident Speaker'. Robin Sundström is a TEDx speaker, Communications Coach, Polyglot and former startup Head of Communications who won the D91 International Speech Contest during his first year as a Toastmaster. This talk explores how anyone can use daily one-minute vlogs to become a better and more confident speaker.

We will also have our hall of fame for those who have achieved awards in Division L this Toastmasters year. Not only that, food will be provided and contests are a great opportunity to meet and network with other toastmasters and guests.

Step back in time to the Jazz bars of New Orleans for '“Scintillating piano-based artistry” from Tim Penn and the Second line, an outfit led by our great friend and veteran pianist. The Second Line draws on the music of Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Dr John, Allen Toussaint and then stirs it up with a pinch of Ray Charles, Tom Waits and Tim’s own original compositions, a recipe that has led to a string of sold out shows in London over the last few years. Tim Penn is one of the most ‘in demand’ keyboard players on the roots, songwriter & blues scenes. Going back to the 1970s, he was a member of Twickenham legend Dorris Henderson’s Eclection and also the Kevin Coyne band alongside Andy Summers (The Police) and Gordon Smith (Described by John Peel as ”The foremost white Blues guitarist in the world “ ) In Tim’s own words: “This is the blues, but with a great big smile on its face”. Over the last few years, The Second Line has firmly established its reputation as one of the top New Orleans R&B bands in London. If you like the Crescent City’s rich heritage of Rhythm and Blues mixed in with a nod back to the Jazz greats like Louis Armstrong and Jelly Roll Morton then this is one band you won’t want to miss. 9pm, Doors from 7pm Iconic speakeasy Ram Jam Records is hidden away behind the award winning Smok’d pub at The Grey Horse Kingston (and yes we serve all their award winning food and drink).

As opposed to historical artefacts, the materials provided are intended to act as emotionally charged, mnemonic devices that function as catalysts for meaningful conversation between participants. Mackenzie Willis (b. 1994) is a Canadian Maker & self-identified MAD woman who uses found objects and traditional craft practices to create reflexive objects and textiles. Willis’s research by art practice concerns Making as a Healing practice by Auto-Ethnography.Having been first diagnosed with Childhood Panic Disorder at the age of six, Willis has reflected upon the physical shapes that her life-long chronic-illness have materialized. Upon first arrival to London, UK in August 2021, Willis utilised Mudlarking as a means of self-therapy due to the lack of access to readily available health-care. Willis has sought comfort by collecting artefacts along the Thames and thereafter, through actions of cleaning, processing and effecting new composite objects by means of rigorous self-reflection. Through the externalization of her illness and the mnemonic quality of the materials, Willis exteriorizes fragility and beared witness in the quality of the found materials. Willis currently works as the Workshop Technician in Makerversity, located under Somerset House. Moreover, Willis has worked extensively in Design Research, most recently with OCADU as a Graduate Research Assistant for OCADU in Toronto, Canada, as well as a Design by Repair Researcher with the Restart Project in London, UK. ____________________________________________________________________ Ticket Prices Free  (Low income/Concessions) £5 (donation ticket for Mackenzie's time) ____________________________________________________________________ On the day of the event guests will be picked from the New Wing reception of Somerset House.

This event will bring together leading global experts in health effects from water-damaged environments. Whilst there is no disagreement on whether mould impacts on human health, this conference will explore the ways in which this happens, where there is consensus, and where there are still key questions that need to be addressed, and what other factors may need to be considered to be able to answer the question does mould really matter? We will be focusing on a few key areas to answer these questions:Genetics- The genetics of risk from exposure will be explored, to help us to consider whether mould matters for everyone, or just those with a specific genetic risk? Triggers- The Conference will also be introducing new elements found in water-damaged environments that may also be affecting human health, such as actinomycetes, endotoxins and beta glucans, This will help us to re-frame the question of does mould really matter, when we place mould and mycotoxins in the wider context of these other factors. We will also be considering in this section the effects of exposure and how this can create a different presentation for individuals. Environmental Factors- From an environmental perspective we will be considering what other factors contribute to sick building syndrome and mediate an environment to increase risk. Action Plans- To round off the day we will be considering options for practitioners to utilise in clinical practice",172.97,172.97,GBP,Colab Services,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-09T09:00:00Z,2024-03-09T17:00:00Z,"CIRS-EU: Envirohealth Forum 2024 ""Does Mould Really Matter?""

Led by an experienced shamanic practitioner, this workshop will guide you on a profound journey of self-discovery, soul-connection, and healing. We will begin our journey a sensual and sweet Blue Lotus Tea Ceremony. Blue Lotus, a revered flower with rich historical and cultural significance, offers a plethora of benefits for women seeking a deep sense of relaxation and inner harmony. Known for its calming properties, Blue Lotus has been used for centuries as a natural remedy for stress relief and anxiety reduction. This enchanting flower also holds aphrodisiac qualities, stimulating sensuality and enhancing mood. Embracing the transformative power of Blue Lotus in a serene tea ceremony can be a beautiful and rejuvenating experience. In the shamanic trance dance sessions, you will learn traditional dance movements and methods that have been used for centuries to induce altered states of consciousness.

This practice promotes deep healing, emotional release, and spiritual awakening. We will then have a heart-full and powerful Hapé Ceremony.

This traditional and legal (UK) plant medicine, made from powdered high quality tobacco and various healing botanicals, has been used for centuries by indigenous tribes in South America. Hapé is known to enhance mental clarity, promote relaxation, and provide a grounding experience. Additionally, it can support respiratory health and improve focus. In a sacred hapé ceremony, where we will gather as a community of women to honor the healing properties of this sacred medicine, connect with our inner wisdom, and create a space of unity and sisterhood. I have been initiated to serve this sacred medicine. Following the Hapé Ceremony, wehre we have cleared our minds and energetic bodies, we go into shamanic journeying with the drum to recieve the messages and healing of our higher selves and the Spirit world. This ancient technique involves using a repetitive drumbeat to enter a trance-like state and embark on a spiritual journey.

We will end the event by a grounding our energies into the Earth and a closing sharing circle.

The session takes place at the Heston branch of the Royal British Legion at 79 New Heston Road, Heston Central, Hounslow, Middlesex, TW5 0LG. If you're fed up with having noisy brakes that always need adjusting, or that only have weak stopping power, this class will teach you how to get them working properly. Over the course of two hours, one of our highly experienced mechanics will take you through how to recable brakes, fit new brake blocks, and then get them optimally set up to give you the best braking. PLEASE NOTE: hydraulic rim brakes, disc brakes, roller brakes and hub brakes are not covered in this class. We may be adding classes for those later in 2024. This is a hands-on class, so you'll be carrying out the work yourself on one of our demonstrator bikes as part of a small group, since we find this is a much more effective way of teaching than just watching a mechanic going through the repairs. Tools and gloves will be provided by us, though if you'd prefer to use your own toolkit where possible, that's also fine.

In return, this new consciousness becomes humanity's. This course is the 7 stage ladder to reach this place and search this consciousness. This is a life-changing seven day course for those who are serious about raising their perception and reaching their highest potential by working from the other world. You will be taken on a journey to remove a lifetime of generational blocks, so you can make the 'Jump' from this world into the other. The course has been running for the last 20 years and many can testify to the amazing journey it provides. Participants have said they have found nothing like it for making such a profound spiritual step in their life. It is structured around ancient and powerful yet relatively unknown Western energy frameworks. Grahame Martin has evolved these frameworks so each participant can journey into their highest consciousness, removing the blocks on the way, changing their perception forever. The purpose of this system is to reach your highest perceptive point and see how you are connected to all things. We have an innate ability to connect to this highest point, although this is mostly shut down. From this place, truth becomes reality. This is the place where all answers and all solutions can be found. All that we search for in the universe creates our consciousness and will materialise down here on Earth in the form of change. This is how change is created: it is first discovered in the invisible world and by entering into human consciousness it enters our physical world as the new.

It becomes even more relevant when multiple researchers collaborate on a particular project and it is necessary to know who changed what, when they did that, and, potentially, to be able to easily revert those changes. When developing software (e.g., just a small script to process your data, a more serious application for your research team, or a professional-level program), not using some form of version control is just unthinkable. As a continuation of the SRUK/CERU Research Computing Workshop series, we will focus on teaching the basics of the main tool used for version control: Git. In addition, you will learn how to use GitHub, an online repository with which you can collaboratively work on a project while keeping all the benefits of version control.

Led by veteran facilitators and leadership development experts Kenny Mammarella-D’Cruz, Ed Frauenheim and Alessandro Ferullo, the workshop will empower you to tap into the deepest parts of yourself. It also will provide practical tools for elevating your leadership and living a fuller, more satisfying life. You will emerge from Authentic Leadership for a Changing World feeling liberated, connected and energised. You will have tools to meet this moment as a conscious male leader and continue your journey with a spring in your step and a twinkle in your eye. You will be on your way toward a more successful, purposeful, soulful life. Key Aspects of the Workshop Freedom: Free your mind. We’ll explore how to update old, confined definitions of manhood that may have limited our effectiveness as leaders in a changing business world. We’ll learn how a “liberating masculinity” frees us to get real, live more expansively, and succeed at work, at home and beyond. Fellowship: Connect with your heart. We’ll build fellowship by telling our stories, learning from others and leaning into brotherhood and community. We’ll become more aware of our core values, speak our truths, and connect deeply with others. We’ll dare to be honest, vulnerable and compassionate in a supportive group atmosphere. Flow: Tap into universal energy. We’ll experience a sense of flow by practising the ancient art of Qigong. Through breathwork and movement, we’ll embody the natural life force – Qi – that allows us to thrive. We will get a sense of being grounded, supported and inspired. Amid today’s turmoil, we’ll experience peace. The Facilitators Kenny Mammarella-D’Cruz is a coach, consultant and best-selling author known as “The Man Whisperer.” Kenny founded MenSpeak Men's Groups CIC - a network of men’s groups that provide a safe and confidential space for men to hang out, be heard, and get real - over two decades ago, serving thousands of men. Kenny has served on the governing council of the ManKind Project UK. He’s also been featured in media outlets including The Times, The Guardian, the BBC and GQ magazine. He now writes a column in a national newspaper. As a child, Kenny experienced death threats, refugee camps and mental health issues. He later became dependent on extreme sports as distractions from his pain. But Kenny sat with his shadows and unlearned his limiting stories, turning addictive adrenaline into an enlivening endorphin buzz that he now shares with clients. Alessandro Ferullo came to the UK to study when he was 9 years-old, and from an early age, he was always searching for a deeper meaning in life. He has owned his own talent recruiting business, as well worked in the worlds of textiles and publishing. Alessandro always has had an interest in different health modalities and personal growth, and he’s been involved with the ManKind Project and men’s work for many years. Allesandro has been studying and teaching the 4,000-year-old energy practice of Qigong for 35 years. Qigong empowers us to take more control of our health and our wellbeing. In 2024 he intends to reach 10 million with Qigong. Alessandro has led Qigong workshops for hundreds of people, with clients including Unilever, ExxonMobil, TTEC and Suez Group. Kenny founded MenSpeak Men's Groups CIC - a network of men’s groups that provide a safe and confidential space for men to hang out, be heard, and get real - over two decades ago, serving thousands of men. Ed Frauenheim is a writer, speaker and consultant, focusing on masculinity matters, leadership and workplace culture. Ed’s stories have been featured in USA Today, Harvard Business Review and Fortune. He has co-authored four books. The latest is Reinventing Masculinity: The Liberating Power of Compassion and Connection. It tells the story of how we are evolving from a cramped, unhealthy, outdated masculinity to one that frees men and all around them to live healthier, fuller, more soulful lives. Ed talks openly about wrestling with anxiety, shame and a sense of failure as a man in a hyper-masculine business climate and winner-take-all world. He also shares the peace he’s found from self-acceptance, mindfulness and community. And he calls on us to rethink our deepest beliefs for a brighter future.",497,497,GBP,Alessandro Ferullo,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-09T10:00:00Z,2024-03-09T17:00:00Z,Authentic Leadership for a Changing World --Workshop to Help Male Leaders,"A Workshop to Help Male Leaders Experience Freedom, Fellowship and Flow

There are lots of organisers who arrange Speed Dating events in London. Be aware that most of these events are organised by 'fly by night' operators who have not been in the business for very long. Since we have been established for over 10 years and with more than 5,000 events under our belt we know what we're doing. Not only have we been featured on several TV shows, we also won the award for the 'Best Speed Dating company' at the UK Dating Awards (a claim no other company can say) with hundreds of positive reviews online and more people attending our events each week than anyone else it's no wonder why we're the market leader for Speed Dating London. Some of the other events you see on Eventbrite generally have poor turnouts with uneven ratios of men and women, unorganized hosts and poor venues. We suggest you always check who the organizer is and if they have a proper website and where that website ranks in Google for 'speed dating London' keyword. If you can only see a paid advert then chances are they are not well established and worth avoiding. What's included? Tickets for this event are £20 and can be booked through this website or DateinaDash. If you have any questions please get in touch!

During this workshop you'll take time for yourself to: Creating an Attraction Board is more than pasting pictures to a board. It's a way of selling it to yourself, anchor to your dreams and allow the magic of manifestation to work in your life.  For instance, when I created my Attraction Board , I included a new car, spa days and a lovely diamond ring and all these things have come true. Driving my new car I realised I’m noticing my make of car everywhere I go. That’s because it’s been brought into my consciousness. Attraction Boards are so powerful. Once you get clarity, you select images and words from magazines and paste them on a poster board. Seeing this board each day aligns your brain with the outcomes you most want to attract. It sounds pretty simple. And yes, there is a process to make your Attraction Board more powerful. So, why doesn’t everyone create Attraction Boards?  Well, in my experience as a Coach and Trainer most of us never make the time. We let our busy, distracted lives keep us, well; busy and distracted. It’s time to change that. Would you like to see how an Attraction Board will change your life?   A full-day immersion for you to concentrate and maintain focus on your authentic life; in a safe environment with like minded people and have FUN!  Due to the deep nature of the work, there are only 6 places available.

Newsflash: your twenty-year-old house is about as haunted as YouTube – MySpace at a push. The present (and past) is outside, in real life, where all the creepy buildings, monuments and verifiable ghost sightings hotspots are. With this in mind, we’re inviting you to visit places that are truly haunted. Let that sink in for a moment. The route you will follow is full of haunted and spooky places, mysterious clues and challenges, and real facts/accounts from the past and present. The experience will play out like you’re the main characters of a movie, only that you’re experiencing everything in the first person! Fun dialogue, intrigue, and unexpected interactions are guaranteed. Embark on a city exploration game in London that will take you through the slashing grounds of the most infamous serial killer in history. With every step you take, you will get closer to solving a mystery that has baffled the world for more than a century: who was Jack the Ripper? Follow clues and solve puzzles to put the pieces together... Are you ready to step into the dark alleys and uncover their sinister secrets? Let's play a real-world adventure! In 1888, a series of horrendous events shook the city of London. 5 murders were committed, unsolved by the London Metropolitan Police, all the work of Jack the Ripper – an unidentified serial killer who terrorized the streets of London but left behind no clues. For more than 130 years, his identity has remained a mystery. You are an investigator reopening the Ripper files. Can you shed new light on the case? Or will you also get lost on the murderer’s trail of darkness? Full flexibility: start at any hour, take a break at any time and resume later This is always available. It's 24/7, every day of the week. This is the safest event you can book: private, no human contact, you will avoid crowds. Play offline: you DON'T NEED an internet connection to play this city game. HOW IT WORKS❓ 1. Book your tickets 🎫 2. Download the Questo app - it's free 📲 3. Head to the starting point📍 WHAT YOU’LL DO The game is an interactive activity where you are guided by a mobile app through the city. With it, you follow directions and solve very fun puzzles, riddles, and cryptic codes. During the game, you will also visit popular and hidden places in the city while learning fun (and we mean it) stories about them. This is a storytelling experience just as much. The people doing these city exploration games gave them an average rating of 4.7/5 around the world.

The course includes a practical 'on-road' cycle training element and gives drivers a 'real life' experience as to the cyclist's perspective of riding on London's roads, as well as in traffic. The training also counts towards the 35 hours DCPC that professional drivers need to complete by every 5 years to retain their Driver Qualification Card. The course consists of two 3.5 hour modules (both delivered the same day) with the first module being a classroom-based theory, and the second module, a practical on-cycle session where drivers get a vulnerable road user's view of the road. Theory Module (3.5 hours) This part of the course focuses on sharing the road safely and highlights the vulnerability of other road users. It also explains how the London streetscape is evolving to encourage more walking and cycling. Subjects covered include Practical Module (3.5 hours) After the initial bicycle control skills training, drivers ride on bikes to areas of potential conflict including junctions, traffic lights and Advanced Stop Lines. Subjects covered include:- Please note: Lunch and travel costs are not included unless arranged with the centre in advance but tea, coffee and light refreshments at all breaks will be provided. IMPORTANT: All Drivers attending must provide an acceptable form of proof of identity in terms of the following:- The requirement to provide an acceptable form of identification must be met to allow Us to register the driver onto both the TfL's 'FORS Trained Driver' database and the DVSA's Driver CPC register to confirm attendance with both organisations. In order for a driver to be uploaded to the FORS/TfL register and/or be accredited with the Driver CPC hours they must complete the entire course. Drivers will only be excused from taking part in the cycle element where a significant medical or psychological issue would risk harm to them or other road users, or if during the cycle familiarisation session, the driver is risk assessed as not safe to ride a bike on public roads - in these instances it is acceptable for the drivers to walk the course meeting up with the cyclists at the exercise/discussion points and joining in with the discussion.

The class is set up to be fairly loose / generic - so that people can work in whatever direction they choose - be it analytical - or something more expressive - in friendly and relaxed environment - with tutor Matt Burden (MA Visual Communication, Royal College of Art) on hand to offer advice and guidance to people that best suits where they're at, and what they're trying to achieve.  Ages 18 and upward.  WHAT IS LIFE DRAWING Life drawing - drawings made from the living naked human form - can be an important way for anyone with an artistic impulse to exercise and develop their skills – I've always likened it to the artistic equivalent of going to the gym. It's also really fun. THE CLASS We'll start with some quicker poses to get everyone warmed up, before moving to some longer poses so you have some time to explore in more depth, with a few breaks in between to share and assess our efforts.  WHAT YOU NEED TO BRING All you really need to get going is some paper and a pencil or two - it really can be as simple as that - and there's much to be said for the simplicity of that.  However, the world is your oyster - so you may want to consider charcoal, crayons, pastels - or something weird and wonderful if you're up for some experimentation - whatever takes your fancy. If you are thinking of getting really extravagant - ie something that might make a mess - please do remember to bring a dust sheet, as we need to take care of the hall.  You may also want something to lean on - boards are great - or easels if that's your thing - though a sturdy sketch book will do just fine in a pinch! There will be a lunch break - so do remember to bring a bite to eat if you think you'll need it. Teas & Coffees will be provided!

The purpose of this yoga lineage is to guide you toward cultivating a conscious connection, integration and awakening of the body, mind, heart and spirit. You will learn and practice Patanjali's 8 limbs of yoga: Work primarily with the Amrit posture sequence, gentle vinyasa flows and extended posture holding times. Explore the deepest levels of body, mind and spirit with the integrative practices of clear intention, breath, meditative awareness and conscious integration. Learn to balance your nervous system with the “first half” and “second half” of a posture. To transition from an active state of “doing” a posture, to a relaxed state of “being”. And to feel the effects of a posture. Learn to consciously encounter your ""edge"" of body and mind to release deep tensions and restore the natural flow of the vital life force energy (prana). Good for all levels, from those with some experience to more experienced practitioners. Some experience with yoga and postures is recommended. BIOGRAPHY I have been guiding spiritual seekers for over 30 years with the self-transformative teachings of yoga, meditation, Ayurveda and breathing.

Authors Nikki Marmery, Nadia Attia and Sarah Underwood will be discussing their books Lilith and Verge, as well as their experiences as a writer and in the publishing industry. All myths retold as fiction, prepare to abandon reality and enter a magical world of Myths and Monsters. About Nikki Marmery - In a former life, Nikki worked as a financial journalist. She now writes fiction from a small village near Amersham, where she lives with her husband and three children. Her first novel, On Wilder Seas (2020), was shortlisted for the Historical Novel Society’s New Novel Award and selected for the Wilbur & Niso Smith Foundation’s #AdventureSociety book club. Her second novel, Lilith (2023), was picked as one of STYLIST’s Best New Feminist Retellings to Read in 2023. About Lilith - In the tradition of Madeline Miller and Claire North, Lilith is a story of the first woman, who was expelled from Paradise for disobedience. In this retelling of the Hebrew myth [NM1] that justified and explained woman's subjection to man, Lilith will have her revenge - however long it takes. In the Garden of Eden, at the beginning of time, an outrageous lie is born: that women are inferior. Inspired by ancient myths and suppressed scriptures, Lilith is a thought-provoking and ambitious novel with an evocative literary voice and a triumphantly engaging heroine. About Nadia Attia - Nadia Attia is a BFI Network Talent Executive and a published journalist. In 2019 she won the FAB (Faber) prize for fiction and was selected for the London Writers Awards. A graduate of the Curtis Brown novel-writing course, Nadia has been published in Spread the Word's City of Stories anthology, Star Songs and Luna Station Quarterly. Verge is her first novel. Follow her @nadia_land_ About Verge - The day Rowena Murray was born, 250 starlings fell like stones from the sky. Ever since, she has been marked by Death. First the visions; then her boyfriend died suddenly; now her father, too. Exploring belief, loyalty and legacies beyond our control, Nadia Attia's thrilling debut is as magnetic and unpredictable as the curse Rowena is racing to escape. About Sarah Underwood - Sarah Underwood grew up in Devon, England. A data scientist by training, she obtained her MEng in Computational Bioengineering at Imperial College, London and her MPhil in Population Health Sciences at the University of Cambridge. She now works in the Big Data Institute at the University of Oxford. Sarah’s first novel, Lies We Sing to the Sea, became an instant New York Times, indie, and international bestseller. Her second novel, Gentlest of Wild Things, will be published in August 2024. About Lies We sing to the Sea - Rising star Sarah Underwood introduces her immersive debut novel Lies We Sing to the Sea, a sapphic epic inspired by Greek mythology. Be transported to the cursed shores of Ithaca with this tale of love and fate, grief and sacrifice, and, ultimately, the power we must find within. The evening will be chaired by Joanne Hodgson - Joanne is a Hampshire-based book blogger and content producer sharing book reviews, independent bookshop spotlights and literary travel ideas online.When she's not reading, she works within education and is passionate about the transformative impact of great storytelling.Blog: Joanne Reads Bookswww.instagram.com/joannereadsbooks www.x.com/jo_reads_bookswww.tiktok.com/joannereadsbooks www.joannereadsbooks.com Part of the Farnham Literary Festival, Event format - Panel Event Ticket Type - General Admission £10.

Nothing had prepared me for the experience of the first breath work session I went to with Mac. It exceeded every expectation I had. Mac was warm and welcoming and reassuring that everything I was experiencing was normal for the process. Having reconnected with myself, I left feeling the happiest I could remember. I could hardly wait to get to the next one. Thank you Mac. Amanda Ridley - Little Friston Retreat I was lucky enough to attend a recent Awaken You session. I've dipped into cold water exposure before but I haven't explored much breathwork and I was intrigued. I cannot believe what happened when all we did was breath. That night I slept for 9 hours and in the morning my body battery was 98% - neither of which have ever happened before. I cannot recommend this enough, truly mind-blowing stuff. Go with an open mind and you'll be surprised as to what will happen. Just wow. Chris - Tec Company CEO I hadn’t really done breathwork before, but I was astounded by the power of each session, comparable in depth and intensity to an ayahuasca retreat, if not more so. Deep seated issues and emotions arose but were worked through and transmuted during the sessions themselves without any real effort or need to analyse or intellectually work things out. I get a strong sense that continue breathwork could be hugely effective in dissolving and unburdening me of unresolved issues, literally allowing life to be a lot lighter, and to equip me to be of better service to the people around me.

Club-level DJing provides the right energy for discerning music enthusiasts on the dance floor. It's called 'dance music' for a reason- and we're here to dance. To move through the soundscape. To rekindle that flame. To bring things back to the roots, and together, elevate and uplift! The music guides, taking us up, and back down again. We follow our inner compass. DANCE: In a purposefully held, sober dance space. With others who share the same love of the music and intention to move. To stretch, to shake, to let go and to expand. Beyond self- and societally- imposed limits. And beyond the restrictions of a club environment, in which the scope for movement might feel limited, compared to the permission we offer ourselves and each other in the conscious dance space. We all move. We don't have to consider ourselves 'dancers.' We all 'dance' our way through life. By ourselves- and in meaningful community. Whether we consider ourselves seasoned dancers or not, we bring with us a willingness to explore. To be with the various aspects of ourselves in movement. With no requirement to move in any particular way. We don't have to be any particular way, so long as we are respectful of ourselves and each other in the space. No-one to please, or get it right for. Whether we're still, or wild- or somewhere in between. Finding our feet as we go. SPACE: Some verbal guidance may be offered, particularly in the warm up... but this is primarily a space in which we find our own feet, dropping into the callings, longings, and creativity of our own Spirit. We give ourselves time and space to be here. To get present. To honour the different rhythms that run through us. Just as the physical space of the venue holds us and our dances- being the container for all that we feel and express- so too, we ourselves are the holding-space for all that we feel and move with. We include it all in our awareness and experience. Witnessing and riding both flowing and edgy, hard and soft, peaceful and wild, integrated or not. It's a spectrum. There is range. Within which to locate ourselves. An organic unfolding. Naturally-arising. Join us in the Auditorium at the Brighthelm Centre in Brighton, for a DEEPER DANCE JOURNEY through sound and motion. It's a wonderfully big, light, centrally-located and easily-accessible space. Answering the call to explore our movement, to dance our own dance, here we enjoy the vast and living potential of freedom in motion. Bring yourself. Bring friends. Know that you are most welcome here. And let us continue to co-create something beautiful and powerful together!",9,15,GBP,Nathan Godolphin,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-09T20:00:00Z,2024-03-09T22:00:00Z,DANCE MUSIC SPACE,"Calling all dancers and electronic music lovers!

Following this, immerse yourself in a transformative sound journey guided by various instruments, including the gentle tones of Tibetan Singing Bowls, customised to meet the needs of participants in the room. As the soothing vibrations penetrate deeply, Emily’s calming voice gently brings you back to awareness, concluding the session. Afterwards, enjoy the opportunity to share your thoughts and reflections while sipping on herbal tea, fostering integration and reflection. Benefits: Research shows that sound healing can rewire the brain, promoting overall well-being. Throughout history, music has been a powerful tool for uplifting mood and fostering holistic healing. Participants often experience increased energy, mental clarity, creativity, and improved relationships with themselves and others. Additionally, sound healing can help reduce stress, lower heart rate, alleviate pain and inflammation, and improve sleep quality and life balance. What to Bring: Wear comfortable, warm clothing to stay cosy during meditation. • Bring a cushion or pillow for added comfort, along with a blanket for warmth. • Feel free to bring extra props like yoga blocks, cushions, bolsters, or an eye pillow for personalised comfort. • While yoga mats are available, you’re encouraged to bring your own for a touch of familiarity.
