Hello, These fortnightly gatherings are an invitation for every woman or whoever identifies as a woman who menstruates to find comfort in a safe space where all-women related experiences can be shared, heard and held by the circle. Why women's circle? Because we all have equal voice to share what moves in us, that is the nature life, circular. No one knows what is like to be another person. The circle holds us in all the experiences we encounter and when we share we weave the circle of holding one another, trusting, learning and anchoring in the lap of our being. What do we explore/do in these meetings? Every gathering has it's own note. We meet in a quiet space of Turquoise Gallery. We have tea together and share how we are where we are in our menstrual cycle. We learn about the seasons of the menstrual cycle and how to honour that flow in our life from summer (ovulation) to post ovulation and bleed (winter). All these hormonal changes in our body are real and living as if they don't affect us is counter-productive to our ebb and flow. We touch on subjects related to the menstrual cycle, menopause, motherhood and more through listening, sharing, movement, inner guided work and drawing/painting. If this resonates with you, get in touch, if you have questions or would like to dip in and get e feel for these gatherings. These sessions are in English language.

Lucie, with Greek roots and a spirit kindled in France, believes dance is more than learned steps: ""You can learn any moves from any dance styles you like!"" But true expression, she says, comes from within: ""But if you want to move from your own groove, find your own style and move in line with how you feel in the moment: you will not find it in a technique or by reproducing another dance move... You will find it by being in the vulnerability of letting your soul be seen!"" Join us to explore movement as a path to your inner self, guided by Lucie's 14 years of experience and her passion for authentic expression.

Lucie, met Griekse roots en een in Frankrijk aangewakkerde geest, gelooft dat dans meer is dan aangeleerde pasjes: ""Je kunt alle bewegingen leren van elke dansstijl die je leuk vindt!"" Maar de echte expressie, zegt ze, komt van binnenuit: ""Maar als je vanuit je eigen ritme wilt bewegen, zoek dan je eigen stijl en beweeg in lijn met hoe je je op dat moment voelt: je zult het niet vinden in een techniek of door het reproduceren nog een dansbeweging... Je zult het vinden door in de kwetsbaarheid te zijn van het laten zien van je ziel!""

4 uren,NA,"De circulaire economie vraagt om echt anders organiseren en samenwerken, maar hoe doe je dat dan concreet? Op 12 maart - tijdens de Week van de Circulaire Economie- organiseert Noorderwind samen met Laatbloeien weer een New Economy Cafe. Het doel van deze cafés is om meer te gaan delen (en vragen) over startups in de nieuwe -circulaire- economie. Voor deze speciale editie doen we dat door het te hebben over New ways to Organise, Invest and Cooperate. Aanmelden kan via Eventbrite, de link vind je in het LinkedIn Event van Noorderwind. Via dit event kun je ook gemakkelijk jouw relevante netwerk uitnodigen. Programma: New ways to Organise, Invest and Cooperate. Hoe zorgen duurzame koplopers van nu ervoor dat hun gedurfde missie ook in de toekomst blijvende impact kan maken? En hoe regel je financiering met zo’n ‘nieuw’ bedrijfsmodel? In een inhoudelijk programma delen ervaringsdeskundigen concrete voorbeelden, geleerde lessen en praktische tips zodat jij je start-up of organisatie ook kunt klaarstomen voor de Nieuwe Economie. 16.00-17.00 Breakout sessie 1: New ways of Organising In de eerste breakout vertellen de founders van VanHier, BlueBlocks, Hollands Wol Collectief en Fairm over hun eerste stappen richting Steward Ownership. Zij zijn met steun van de provincie Zuid-Holland bezig geweest met alle voorbereidingen of én hoe hun organisaties volgens het Steward-Ownership model vorm te gaan geven. Waar moet je rekening mee houden als je dit model wilt gaan gebruiken, wat betekent het voor je dagelijkse processen, je administratie, je belanghebbenden? Deze sessie gaat in op deze vragen en de praktische keuzes die je kunt en moet maken als bedrijf om het Steward-Owned bedrijfsmodel te gaan hanteren. De verschillende routes en keuzes die gemaakt kunnen worden in dit proces zijn vormgegeven in een ‘Steward Ownership how-to’ handleiding, een juridisch contract wat gebruikt kan worden in gesprekken met investeerders en een visuele beslisboom, die tijdens deze breakout sessie wordt gepresenteerd door We Are Stewards en Noorderwind. Deze documenten gaan ervoor zorgen dat alle impact koplopers in de toekomst makkelijker richting Steward Ownership kunnen navigeren. Dit ‘doorbraakproject light’ is tot stand gekomen met steun van de Provincie Zuid Holland. 17:45 - 18.30 Breakout sessie 2: New ways of Investing In dit programma onderdeel gaan we in gesprek met Bianca Ernst van Buurman, die een organisatiemodel hanteert gebaseerd op Social Franchise principes. Wat houdt Buurman’s organisatievorm precies in? Welke keuzes heeft Buurman gemaakt om tot dit model te komen? Hoe gaat Buurman haar groei organiseren vanuit een social franchise organisatie? En hoe hebben zij een impact financier aan boord gekregen? Ook lichten zij toe hoe zij succesvol een investeerder aantrokken en waarom deze investeerder koos om in zee te gaan met de groeiplannen. 18:15-18:45 breakout sessie 3: News ways of Cooperation In de derde breakout sessie vertelt Noorderwind over haar keuze om de overstap te maken van BV naar Cooperatie. Sanne Mylonas en Arthur von Kriegenberg vertellen over het proces en alle praktische stappen die nodig zijn om een cooperatie op te richten. 16:00-19:30 New Startups (markt) Tijdens het hele programma kun je de Noorderwind startup markt bezoeken.

Tijdens de meet-ups ontmoet je de mensen achter Lenteland, de boeren en elkaar. We bespreken het concept Nieuwe Rijkdom.

NA,NA,"Door een ‘circulaire bril’ naar bankfinanciering kijken Circulaire ondernemers hebben vaak moeite om bankfinanciering te krijgen. En als ze al een voorstel van een bank krijgen, is de rente hoog. Dit heeft te maken met de ‘lineaire bril’ waarmee banken en andere financiële instellingen de kansen en risico’s van circulair ondernemen inschatten.  Om in de toekomst binnen de planetaire grenzen te opereren, is de transitie naar een circulaire economie noodzakelijk. Maar de manier waarop wij ons financiële systeem hebben ingericht helpt niet om de geldstromen de juiste, circulaire kant op te laten vloeien. Op lange termijn zal het financiële systeem dus anders moeten worden ingericht. Samen met welwillende mensen uit de financiële sector zijn wij aan de slag gegaan om door een ‘circulaire bril’ naar financieringen of investeringen te kijken.   Toch willen we ook op korte termijn graag resultaten behalen en aan de slag. Wat moet gebeuren om het door banken financieren van circulaire ondernemingen makkelijker te maken? Wat kan er worden gedaan om meer geld naar circulaire ondernemers te laten vloeien?  Eén van de knoppen waaraan gedraaid kan worden, zijn de risicomodellen van banken. Een bank baseert haar keuze om wel of niet te financieren, en zo ja tegen welke rente, immers voor een groot deel op de uitkomst van hun risicomodel. Dit risicomodel geeft een perceptie van de werkelijkheid, veelal op basis van historische data. Circulariteit wordt daardoor momenteel niet of nauwelijks meegenomen, aangezien er nog geen data beschikbaar zijn. Kortom: de voordelen van circulair ondernemen worden niet (h)erkend en de risico’s worden overschat.   Achtergrond Vier Nederlandse banken (ABN AMRO, ING, Triodos en Rabobank) en Invest-NL, een duurzame investeerder, hebben de ambitie uitgesproken om meer circulaire ondernemingen te financieren, maar merken in de praktijk dat dit nog niet snel genoeg gaat. Vanuit de Kopgroep Circulair Financieren hebben we daarom de mouwen opgestroopt en een alternatief risicomodel ontwikkeld, dat circulaire kansen en risico’s integraal mee te nemen in beslissingen. Om een voorbeeld te noemen: wanneer het een circulaire ondernemer lukt om zijn eigen product in de toekomst terug te halen en het een tweede leven te geven, is het toekomstige grondstoffenrisico kleiner. Het heeft ook een prijsvoordeel: de ondernemer krijgt de producten ook nog voor de hedendaagse prijs, niet voor de toekomstige, hogere prijs.  Hun missie is om de perceptie van financiële instellingen op circulaire ondernemingen te veranderen. Hiervoor is er een risicoscore ontwikkeld, die de kansen en risico’s van circulaire ondernemers vaak positiever beoordeelt. Daarin worden nieuwe circulaire risicofactoren, zoals de circulariteit van het product, de geschiktheid van het product voor circulariteit en de schaarste van de gebruikte grondstoffen meegewogen. Maar ook bestaande factoren, zoals de robuustheid van de contracten en de ervaring van het managementteam, worden door een circulaire bril bekeken. Het doel van de scorecard is om data op te halen om te laten zien dat circulair ondernemen inderdaad minder risicovol is.   Ben je ook benieuwd hoe dit werkt? Meld je dan nu aan! —> En mocht je alvast willen proberen wat deze Circular Risk Scorecard kan, vul hem dan via deze link in.
