NA,Sold out,NA,"You have a glorious opportunity to get your message into the world. Never before has there been such an exciting time in communication. The ability to transmit your words across the world has existed for decades. What has changed a result of COVID-19 is now people are LISTENING. Virtual communication has now been accepted as the norm. People know that they need to tune into the Facebook Lives and join the Zoom meetings otherwise they are going to be left out of the loop. They are ready to hear your message. Are you ready to give it to them? Your phone and your computer are all you need to make a difference in the world. You have a voice, it’s time to use it. You have a story, it’s time to tell it. You have a message, it’s time to share it. Imagine being able to reach people in places you’ve never heard of and changing the lives of people you have never met. That possibility is more real than ever thanks to virtual speaking. You still aren’t 100% sure about all this, are you? You’ve done some Facebook Lives, you’ve been in some Zoom meetings and you’ve filmed a few selfie videos. You’re trying things out, but you’re not as confident as you’d like to be. It still feels weird not being able to see people. You still feel self conscious seeing yourself on camera. You aren’t getting the likes and comments that you see other people getting on their lives and videos. Does it feel like you’ve been left behind by all this change? You haven’t been left behind yet…but you will if you don’t act now. When the technology arrived to do virtual speaking, only a tiny fraction of people adopted it. During the 2010s they rose to the top of their fields. The “second wave” is now here, and you’ve got to catch it if you want to have a meaningful impact during the 2020s. I joined the second wave late. I started my Youtube channel in 2015, 10 years after Youtube had been created. I first used Zoom in 2018, 5 years after Zoom had been created. I was quicker on the uptake with Facebook Live, being one of the first people in my industry to use it in 2016. I didn’t have the audience nor the engagement of my peers, but I kept learning the craft. When lockdown hit in 2020, I was able to seamlessly transition my business online. I’d been preparing for half a decade to speak virtually whilst the competition got caught with their pants down. I managed to grow my audience and increase my income in 2020 when so many businesses struggled or even sadly closed up shop. There’s one thing that made the difference for me and it will make the difference for you too. I knew how to communicate online. I was far more confident with the tech, more practiced in the communication and more open to the switch to virtual. We still have people who don’t know how to unmute themselves on Zoom. We still have people who speak like an emotionless robot on their Youtube videos. We still have people who think virtual was just a “phase” and not a transition into a new way of doing things. Don’t be one of those people. The second wave of virtual communication is here...are you going to jump on it? This is going to be far bigger than the first wave. If you don’t jump on now, you will get swept away. Equally, if you put in the work now to master virtual speaking, you are going to flourish for the next decade. That is what this Virtual Speaking Masterclass is going to help you do. There are three basic building blocks you need to be a great virtual speaker. Firstly you will learn how to make friends with the camera. Making friends with the camera means that you will: Secondly you will learn why it’s so important to create an “active window”. An active window means that you: Thirdly you will learn how to effectively interact with your audience. Strong interaction means that your audience will: Are you ready for the second wave? Then grab your surfboard and sign up for the masterclass! In the true spirit of Virtual Speaking, we will of course be hosting this class virtually so that you can join us from the comfort of your own home. FAQs Is this definitely an online event? Because the event has a physical location? Yes this is entirely online. The physical location allows people in your city (such as you!) to find the event as it shows up as being geographically close to them. Where can I access the masterclass? You can attend the masterclass live on Zoom. You will be sent the link on the day of the masterclass. The event repeats each month, do I need to attend on a monthly basis? No. The same series is repeated every month. You only need to attend one event.",0,0,GBP,David McCrae,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-09T19:00:00Z,2024-03-09T20:30:00Z,Virtual Speaking Masterclass Malaga,Online Workshop Teaching You How To Speak Online!,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/virtual-speaking-masterclass-malaga-tickets-774543539577,marbella

Explore the deepest levels of body, mind and spirit with the integrative practices of clear intention, breath, meditative awareness and conscious integration.

Volveremos a visitar el Hospital de la Caridad, en exclusiva, a puerta cerrada, con grupos reducidos y alumbrándonos con candiles para descubrir espacios cerrados a la visita ordinaria y conocer los ritos y secretos de una de las hermandades más importantes de la ciudad de Sevilla. La vida y la muerte se irán entrelazando en una atmósfera tenue que inundará la iglesia, pudiendo admirar las obras de arte bajo la luz con la que las miraron Mañara, Murillo o Pedro Roldán.  Como en ocasiones anteriores el 50% del precio de la entrada se destina a proyectos solidarios y a la residencia de mayores desfavorecidos del Hospital de la Caridad. Los participantes descubrirán de una forma atractiva, dinámica y participativa algunas de las obras de arte más importantes obras del Barroco sevillano, a la luz de candiles, con lo que queremos recrear la luz original de la Iglesia en la época en que Murillo, Valdés Leal o Pedro Roldán la decoraron, además se podrán ver por primera vez las dos grandes Obras de Murillo “La multiplicación de los Panes y los peces” y “Moises en la roca de Horeb” recién restaurados por el IAPH en sus marcos y en su lugar original dentro de la Iglesia de San Jorge. La visita se estructura en torno a tres universos: Quién fue realmente Miguel Mañara, qué le impulsó a construir el Hospital de Caridad, o el porqué de su desprecio a las riquezas y los bienes terrenales serán algunas de las cuestiones que resolvamos en este primer bloque de la visita donde descubriremos la trasformación de las atarazanas en hospital y cómo era el funcionamiento de esta institución en el siglo XVII.  Realizaremos un recorrido por su vida a través de sus objetos personales; su espada, su máscara mortuoria, las llaves de su ataúd o la pintura: Miguel Mañara leyendo la Regla de la Santa Caridad (Valdés Leal, 1681); ó el  Cristo Crucificado de Zurbarán. Postrimerías: Espiritualidad, Vida y muerte en el Barroco. Inmersión en la simbología del Barroco. La vida y la muerte a través de las obras de Valdés Leal, Murillo o Pedro Roldán. Arquitectura pintura y escultura nos ayudarán a comprender el espíritu del Barroco con sus vanidades y opulencias, para reflexionar sobre la fugacidad de la vida y el fin de la misma. Descubriremos a la luz de candiles Las postrimerías de Valdés Leal, reflexionando sobre la fugacidad de la vida y la inutilidad de acaparar riquezas y glorias, cuando sólo la muerte y el olvido es lo que queda. A continuación iremos desgranando el programa iconográfico diseñado por el propio Mañara y realizado por los autores más importantes del Barroco español, Murillo, Valdés Leal y Pedro Roldán: El ejercicio de la caridad: Mitos, Ritos y Misterios de la Hermandad. ¿Qué es la Hermandad de la Caridad?, ¿Cuáles son sus ritos?, ¿Cuáles son las funciones de sus hermanos?, ¿Qué hermanos ilustres han formado parte de ella?, o ¿Cuál es la finalidad de la institución?. Durante los últimos minutos de la visita subiremos a la planta noble, para descubrir el ejercicio de la caridad y su historia, . Visitaremos la Biblioteca en donde estarán libros y documentos relacionados con Murillo como su carta de entrada a la hermandad y otros referentes a su paso por la misma. Visitaremos la galería de personajes ilustres con retratos de “Retratos de los Duques de Montpensier”, D. Antonio de Orleans y Doña María Luisa de Borbón o de Isabel II. Y por último Entraremos en la Sala de Cabildos alta, en donde además de los destacados  ocho lienzos de Miguel Luna, los únicos conservados de este autor podremos contemplar Visión de Constantino (Francisco Herrera “El viejo”, 1614), el único conservado de toda la serie de la historia de la Santa Cruz. La pieza más destacada de la sala es la Cruz de los ajusticiados, Pieza que se utilizaba para dar la extremaunción a los reos condenados a muerte y que es una pieza de la escuela sevillana de Pedro Roldán.

La Real Academia de Bellas Artes de Santa Isabel de Hungría con la colaboración de Engranajes Culturales han diseñado una serie de visitas nocturnas a la Casa de los Pinelo, sede de la institución y una de las casas palacio más singulares de la ciudad. La visita se estructurará en torno a los personajes que moraron la casa y a las distintas memorias que conforman la historia y el patrimonio material e inmaterial de este lugar.
Durante el recorrido no sólo vamos a descubrir la historia de esta casa y de la ciudad, sino a los personajes que en ella han morado ¿Qué relación tienen con este lugar Murillo, Luis Montoto, Picasso, Gonzalo Bilbao o Antonio Susillo?  Nos adentraremos a puerta cerrada y bajo la luz de la luna en uno de los lugares más fascinantes de la ciudad para descubrir entre sus muros a ilustres personajes, a hombres y mujeres que hicieron de Las Artes su vida y que nos dejaron su memoria escondida en las estancias de la casa.
En el recorrido podremos disfrutar de su extenso, rico y a veces desconocido patrimonio, no sólo arquitectónico, sino que en nuestro paseo descubriremos obras pictóricas atribuidas a importantes autores como Pablo Picasso, o el “Retrato de Don Jacobo Fitz James Stuart y Falcó, XVII Duque de Alba” pintado por Fernando Álvarez de Sotomayor y cedido para su exposición por la XVIII Duquesa de Alba. Además de otras pinturas de grandes pintores sevillanos como García Ramos, Gonzalo Bilbao o Alfonso Grosso. También descubriremos algunas de las piezas más importantes de la escultura contemporánea sevillana, gracias a la colección conservada en la galería alta.  Además podremos disfrutar de una de las colecciones más importantes de Andalucía de Arte oriental y la colección de Arte contemporáneo.

En nuestro paseo también descubriremos documentos tan interesantes como el original y manuscrito por Murillo por el que funda la “Academia del Arte de la Pintura”. Y por supuesto obras curiosas como un capote de paseo autografiado por el propio Pablo Picasso o una escultura de la Diosa romana Pomona, que hoy preside el jardín de la casa pero que en su día estuvo en la fachada principal del Mercado de la Encarnación.
Esta visita nocturna aunará Historia, Arte y Memorias de interesantísimos personajes, para acercarnos de una manera única a un lugar excepcional de la ciudad.

O﻿ne of the most important roles in a Flamenco performance is that of a Palmero (the hand clapper). YES, you heard correctly! You won't ever see a flamenco show without one or two people in the back clapping their hands. What they are doing is called making Compás, or in other words, controlling the rhythm of the dance so that the singer, guitar player, and dancer are all on the same page. This important role sounds easy, but there is an art to clapping your hands in Flamenco, and that's exactly what you will learn in this workshop. Ever wonder what's happening when you watch a live Flamenco performance? Most Flamenco Tablaos are improvised, which is the beauty of this ancient art form. In this workshop, you'll learn Flamenco Compás  and Palmas (rhythm and clapping). Once you have the basics of rhythm, we'll show you some codes between musicians, dancers, and palmeros that happen during a live Tablao and put it to the test with a flamenco dancer and a flamenco guitar player!

NA,Sold out,NA,"You have a glorious opportunity to get your message into the world. Never before has there been such an exciting time in communication. The ability to transmit your words across the world has existed for decades. What has changed a result of COVID-19 is now people are LISTENING. Virtual communication has now been accepted as the norm. People know that they need to tune into the Facebook Lives and join the Zoom meetings otherwise they are going to be left out of the loop. They are ready to hear your message. Are you ready to give it to them? Your phone and your computer are all you need to make a difference in the world. You have a voice, it’s time to use it. You have a story, it’s time to tell it. You have a message, it’s time to share it. Imagine being able to reach people in places you’ve never heard of and changing the lives of people you have never met. That possibility is more real than ever thanks to virtual speaking. You still aren’t 100% sure about all this, are you? You’ve done some Facebook Lives, you’ve been in some Zoom meetings and you’ve filmed a few selfie videos. You’re trying things out, but you’re not as confident as you’d like to be. It still feels weird not being able to see people. You still feel self conscious seeing yourself on camera. You aren’t getting the likes and comments that you see other people getting on their lives and videos. Does it feel like you’ve been left behind by all this change? You haven’t been left behind yet…but you will if you don’t act now. When the technology arrived to do virtual speaking, only a tiny fraction of people adopted it. During the 2010s they rose to the top of their fields. The “second wave” is now here, and you’ve got to catch it if you want to have a meaningful impact during the 2020s. I joined the second wave late. I started my Youtube channel in 2015, 10 years after Youtube had been created. I first used Zoom in 2018, 5 years after Zoom had been created. I was quicker on the uptake with Facebook Live, being one of the first people in my industry to use it in 2016. I didn’t have the audience nor the engagement of my peers, but I kept learning the craft. When lockdown hit in 2020, I was able to seamlessly transition my business online. I’d been preparing for half a decade to speak virtually whilst the competition got caught with their pants down. I managed to grow my audience and increase my income in 2020 when so many businesses struggled or even sadly closed up shop. There’s one thing that made the difference for me and it will make the difference for you too. I knew how to communicate online. I was far more confident with the tech, more practiced in the communication and more open to the switch to virtual. We still have people who don’t know how to unmute themselves on Zoom. We still have people who speak like an emotionless robot on their Youtube videos. We still have people who think virtual was just a “phase” and not a transition into a new way of doing things. Don’t be one of those people. The second wave of virtual communication is here...are you going to jump on it? This is going to be far bigger than the first wave. If you don’t jump on now, you will get swept away. Equally, if you put in the work now to master virtual speaking, you are going to flourish for the next decade. That is what this Virtual Speaking Masterclass is going to help you do. There are three basic building blocks you need to be a great virtual speaker. Firstly you will learn how to make friends with the camera. Making friends with the camera means that you will: Secondly you will learn why it’s so important to create an “active window”. An active window means that you: Thirdly you will learn how to effectively interact with your audience. Strong interaction means that your audience will: Are you ready for the second wave? Then grab your surfboard and sign up for the masterclass! In the true spirit of Virtual Speaking, we will of course be hosting this class virtually so that you can join us from the comfort of your own home. FAQs Is this definitely an online event? Because the event has a physical location? Yes this is entirely online. The physical location allows people in your city (such as you!) to find the event as it shows up as being geographically close to them. Where can I access the masterclass? You can attend the masterclass live on Zoom. You will be sent the link on the day of the masterclass. The event repeats each month, do I need to attend on a monthly basis? No. The same series is repeated every month. You only need to attend one event.",0,0,GBP,David McCrae,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-09T19:00:00Z,2024-03-09T20:30:00Z,Virtual Speaking Masterclass Seville,Online Workshop Teaching You How To Speak Online!,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/virtual-speaking-masterclass-seville-tickets-774542305887,marbella
