This is an event for men and women - after all it isn't just a social issue that impacts women, its an economic one that impacts all of us: ‚ÄúIt's so important to bring gender parity to our countries and to our lives ‚Äì for more productivity and a better economy for everybody.‚Äù - was the quote that came out of The World Economic Forum this year. The Forum‚Äôs Global Gender Gap Report 2023, which measures four key gender gaps, found that the Economic Participation and Opportunity gap has only closed by just over 60%.

1 hour 30 minutes,Mobile eTicket,Contact the organiser to request a refund.,"From Palaces of Art to the Studios of Bohemia: Artists‚Äô houses in Victorian Kensington and Chelsea The second half of the 19th century was a great time to be a painter. More people bought art than ever before and the most successful artists, like Leighton and Luke Fildes, were showered with public honours and earned incomes that by today‚Äôs standards made them millionaires. They commissioned magnificent, purpose-built studio houses in the leafy suburbs of Holland Park and Kensington. The less wealthy and more unconventional, like Rossetti and Whistler, gravitated towards Chelsea, occupying picturesque old buildings that lined the riverside or innovative new studio‚Äôs in Tite Street. This lecture reviews the two most famous artists‚Äô colonies - Melbury Road, Kensington and Cheyne Walk and Tite Street, Chelsea - and explores the lives and interiors of the painters who lived there. Jo Banham is a freelance curator, lecturer and writer. Previously she worked at the V&A, National Portrait Gallery, and Tate Britain as Head of Public Programmes. She is currently writing a book on the History of Wallpaper. FAQs How do I get to St Mary Abbots, Kensington?

Let's build a more equitable future together! A few words about our guest speaker Faye Allen: 30 Years of Shaping the Future in Construction For three decades, Faye Allen has been a trailblazer in the construction industry. Starting as a trainee quantity surveyor at 18, she ascended the ranks, showcasing unparalleled dedication and expertise. Today, Faye is a Director at J.S. Held, a highly experienced Chartered Quantity Surveyor with a remarkable track record. Her journey has evolved into a testament to breaking glass ceilings in construction. Faye's role extends beyond traditional boundaries. She navigates complex disputes, offering support to construction and engineering clients globally. Her prowess in expert witness roles, high-value disputes, and international dispute resolution has solidified her reputation. In addition to her impactful career, Faye has committed herself to advancing gender equality in construction. Recognised by Whose Who Legal and elevated to a Director at Arcadis in 2021, Faye's influence is felt worldwide. As a United Nations UK Delegate for CSW67, she addresses critical themes like innovation, technological change, and education for gender equality. Faye's concerns, shared on LinkedIn, echo the urgency for change, with the UN projecting gender equality 300 years away. Faye's dedication extends to her company's commitment to the Equal Representation for Experts Pledge. A member of the Global Steering Committee, she champions equity for female experts in Quantum, Delay, Engineering, and more. Her advocacy doesn't stop there. Faye actively speaks against injustice in the workplace, sharing insights at events like London Build and The Inspiring Women in Construction Awards. Her passion transcends borders, reaching schools and tertiary institutions, where she serves as a STEM Ambassador, inspiring the next generation. In her latest endeavor, Faye is penning a book on her 30 years in the industry. Through extensive research, she delves into the experiences of women in construction, identifying challenges and proposing solutions. Her ultimate goal is to reshape the industry into a fair and equitable space for everyone, regardless of gender, race, or background. Faye Allen is not just a professional; she is a catalyst for positive change in the construction landscape. #WomenInConstruction #BreakingBarriers #FayeAllenEvent See our impressive launch October 2023 at the House of Lords, Parliament in London.

The evening begins with a showcase of Petra Haller's debut album, ""Shoulders I Stand On,"" now on vinyl - a unique tapestry composed of rhythmic tap dance and harmonious piano melodies that break through conventional jazz barriers. Celebrated by Jazzwise magazine as a Rising Jazz Artist of 2020, Haller has been pushing creative boundaries by integrating tap dance into the jazz and improvised music scenes. Over the years, her auditory experiments in partnership with the gifted Meg Morley have yielded rich, rhythmic conversations, which got their full expression in the album ""Shoulders I Stand On,"" recorded at Ocean Sound Studios in Giske, Norway, in November 2022. Comprising nine compelling tracks, ""Shoulders I Stand On"" brings to life an intriguing interplay between the rhythmic essence of tap dance and the harmonic charm of the piano. Whether it‚Äôs the nuanced exchange in tracks like ""Forever and a Day,"" Morley's melodious contributions in ""Call of the Birds"" and ""Fearless,"" or the intense tension in ‚ÄúThicker than Blood,"" the album stretches the boundaries of the contemporary jazz form. The latter half of the night unfolds into an immersive improvisational experience with the inaugural performance of Haller's new project, 'Orbit.'

Hundreds were killed, millions were affected. Communities were displaced and two main rivers became mud, flooding the Atlantic Ocean with rejeito, or tailings, the toxic waste accumulated in massive dams over many years.Both dams that collapsed, in Mariana and Brumadinho districts, were operated by transnational mining giant Vale and certified safe by the state government of Minas Gerais, which is home to another 354 highly precarious dams. Further dam collapses threaten millions in Brazil who live below these ticking time bombs. The shocking images of the two mining tragedies were explored to exhaustion by mainstream media. The documentary ‚ÄúRejeito‚Äù, by Pedro de Filippis, points to the backstage and beyond following Teca, the sole citizen representative on the state environmental council. She voted against the certification of the dams which collapsed.

All the Wide Border is a personal journey through the places, amongst the people, and across the divides of the border between England and Wales. Taking in some of our loveliest landscapes, and our darkest secrets, this is a region of immeasurable wonder and interest. It is here that the deepest roots and thorniest paradoxes of Britishness lie. The border between the countries, even as a concept, is ragged, jagged and many-layered. Mike has adored and explored these places his entire life. Born in England but settled in Wales, he finds himself typical of many in being pulled in both directions. Picking apart the many notions and clich√©s of Englishness, Welshness and indeed Britishness, Mike plays with the very idea of borders: our fascination with them, our need for them, and our response to their power. In his hands, the England‚ÄìWales frontier is revealed to be a border within us all, and it is fraying, fast. 'No-one maps the secrets of the UK quite like Mike Parker‚Äô Ayesha Hazarika ‚ÄòA kind of mini-biography of the British psyche emerges from Parker's work‚Äô Horatio Clare ‚ÄòPart history, part psychogeography, part polemic, part panegyric, part love letter... engaging, entertaining and very readable‚Äô Nation Cymr ‚ÄòI loved this book‚Ä¶ funny, thoughtful and evocative‚Äô Jesse Armstrong, creator of Succession ‚ÄòBlending history, literature and personal anecdote, Mike Parker writes with energy and wit‚Äô Times Literary Supplement About the author: Mike Parker was born in England and has lived in Wales for half of his life. His other books include the bestseller Map Addict, The Wild Rover and On the Red Hill, which was shortlisted and Highly Commended for the 2020 Wainwright Prize for UK Nature Writing and won the non-fiction Wales Book of the Year Award. In 2021, he received the Glyndwr Award for outstanding contribution to the arts in Wales.

3 hours,Mobile eTicket,Contact the organiser to request a refund.,"In the early '60s, four friends from Liverpool formed a band. But this is not the 'fab four' story we know. Mary, Sylvia, Valerie and Pamela - also known as The Liverbirds - were one of the world's first all-female rock'n'roll bands. At an early gig, backstage at the Cavern Club, a young John Lennon told them that 'girls don't play guitars'. But they took that as a challenge. Despite the early scepticism, they won over tough crowds, toured stadiums, recorded two hit albums, and played with the Kinks, Rolling Stones and Chuck Berry - all in the space of just five years. Now, the two surviving members of the band tell their incredible story in full for the first time - capturing a lost era of liberation and rock'n'roll, as they thrived in the vibrant Merseybeat music scene and formed a friendship that has endured through the decades. Lucy O‚ÄôBrien is the author of Madonna: Like An Icon (2018), which was translated into 13 languages. She also wroteShe Bop: The Definitive History of Women in Popular Music (published in three editions). It inspired the 2002 Radio 2 series She Bop, and two exhibitions: She Bop at the National Portrait Gallery in 2001, and She-Bop-A-Lula, at the Strand Gallery, 2012. She collaborated with Alison Goldfrapp for the chapter: 'Country Girl: Rural Feminism in the Performance of Alison Goldfrapp', in Mute Records: Artists, Business, History (2018).

She‚Äôs worked for the music press since the 1980s, starting on NME and contributing to a range of titles including Q, Mojo, The Sunday Times, The Guardian and The Quietus.

The Secret Agent, Verloc, in Conrad's novel is a double agent, ¬†blackmailed to commit an outrage which ends in family tragedy. ¬†The death of Stevie, Verloc's son in law, ¬†is closely based on a real anarchist explosion near the Greenwich Observatory in 1894.

It was awarded The Best Private Members Club by London Lifestyle Award and for those who have been there already, it is not a surprise. However, it is not very often that they open their doors to the public and this event is also an opportunity not to be missed. Ideally located in the middle of the City (Liverpool Street, Old Street and Moorgate stations are all very close) Eight Club boasts elegant design and comfortable sofas (and plenty of them !) For our event, we have reserved the entire bar, so that we can mix and mingle and meet old and new friends, new contacts, and, why not, new clients too! We only have a maximum capacity of 50 guests at this venue, so it's recommended for those of you who like intimate events. This also means that it sells out very fast, so early booking is highly recommended. The purpose is to make connections, build relationships, find synergies, and see how we can help others. This all leads to business growth for all the attendees and their connections. The reason the events we organize are so successful is that we follow a very simple, but effective formula. One week before the event we create a WhatsApp group with those attendees who wish to start getting to know each other. This allows each participant to set up meetings with those they wish to meet during (or even before) the event. It's a very simple program: you'll be given a warm welcome y our team, and we'll find out who you'd like to meet and make meaningful introductions so that you're guaranteed to meet quality people.

Trauma is an innate experience which all humans experience in our day to day lives. Humans however are the only animals who cannot release trauma naturally and instead recycle it into our muscles and nervous systems. These traumatic events that we experience are embedded into our bodies and each time we think about these fearful experiences, our trauma is more deeply anchored into our bodies and become more difficult to release. This can lead to pent up emotions and never realising how our bodies have a secret weapon to release what is stored deep inside. Our bodies have the wisdom to heal trauma and restore goodness.

The course includes a practical on-cycle session and a theory module. Both modules (i.e., the practical and on-cycle sessions) are 3.5 hours each, counting towards seven hours of Driver CPC, plus the mandatory work-related road risk training as required at FORS Silver.

Generally, the only reasons for not taking part in the cycle element are on medical grounds, or if during the cycle familiarisation session, the driver is risk assessed as not safe to ride a bike on public roads ‚Äì in these instances it is acceptable for the drivers to walk the course meeting up with the cyclists at the exercise/discussion points and joining in with the discussion.

Vivien will discuss her book and talk about why young women dressed as men to fight as soldiers in the 17th to 20th centuries. Hundreds of known women cross-dressers were in Britain, Europe and the Americas, yet they have been erased from social and military history. Copies of Vivien's Book will be on sale after the session for a discounted price of ¬£8, cash or card. Key information about booking: Vivien Morgan is a former BBC and ITN TV News Journalist and Documentary Director, who picked up a camera to become a TV Videojournalist pioneer. Travelling undercover she reported from the closed Communist countries, from Tibet and Myanmar and later from much of Sub-Saharan and West Africa as well as the Middle East and Iran.Her fascination with these historic young women who cross-dressed in the 17th-20th centuries came from her own experience of what it meant to hide your identity to get your story, but not going as far as swapping skirts for trousers and signing-up for the army to fight! Fascination turned into research and ended up with this book to commemorate them.

With over 50,000 customers and more than 5,000 events organised we are the market leaders when it comes to Speed Dating in London. We have been hosting our Speed Dating events in Richmond since 2012 and it is a very popular evening and the busiest event for singles in South West London.  Our Speed Dating event in Richmond is for the age group 30-50 (it's a guide so a few years either side is absolutely fine!) the wide age group means there is a great mix of personalities and types so there is bound to be someone you're interested in! Infact, one happy couple tied the knot after meeting at our event in Richmond in 2017. The events take place in One Kew Road, a cosy pub situated opposite the train station making it very easy to travel to and find. We have the upstairs room exclusively and it's very big which means the dates are spaced out making it easy to hear your date. As this is one of our most popular nights, you can expect to meet at least 20 people over the course of the evening with each date lasting around 4 minutes.   Registration starts at 7:30pm and the action kicks off at 8pm. On arrival at the venue head upstairs and our host will greet you and explain the rules. Grab a drink at the bar and find your seat in good time before the fun begins. Don't worry if you've never done it before because most people are in the same boat and don't panic if you're flying solo because we are on hand to break the ice and introduce you to others. After a brief introduction the event begins and the men will rotate every 4 minutes when the whistle sounds. 4 minutes is enough time to establish whether you'd like to see that person again or not. It's fun, it's frantic and it's good fun! We will provide everything you need (name tags, scorecards & pens) or you can complete your matches on our mobile website. After each round simply make notes on who you like. A 'yes' and a 'yes' is a mutual match but we also offer a 'friend' option as a great way to make new connections. We believe there is no better way to meet new people than in person so ditch the endless dating apps and book a ticket to one of our upcoming Speed Dating events in Richmond today! What happens if I have no matches? The good news is, we have a 100% 'No Match' guarantee which means if you don't meet anyone you'd like to see again you can attend another event for FREE. To recap..

As this is one of our most popular nights, you can expect to meet at least 20 people over the course of the evening with each date lasting around 4 minutes.   Registration starts at 7:30pm and the action kicks off at 8pm. On arrival at the venue head upstairs and our host will greet you and explain the rules. Grab a drink at the bar and find your seat in good time before the fun begins. Don't worry if you've never done it before because most people are in the same boat and don't panic if you're flying solo because we are on hand to break the ice and introduce you to others. After a brief introduction the event begins and the men will rotate every 4 minutes when the whistle sounds. 4 minutes is enough time to establish whether you'd like to see that person again or not. It's fun, it's frantic and it's good fun! We will provide everything you need (name tags, scorecards & pens) or you can complete your matches on our mobile website. After each round simply make notes on who you like. A 'yes' and a 'yes' is a mutual match but we also offer a 'friend' option as a great way to make new connections. We believe there is no better way to meet new people than in person so ditch the endless dating apps and book a ticket to one of our upcoming Speed Dating events in Richmond today! What happens if I have no matches? The good news is, we have a 100% 'No Match' guarantee which means if you don't meet anyone you'd like to see again you can attend another event for FREE. To recap..

The meetings are being held across the country in March 2024 in twilight or Saturday sessions. The aim of the face-to-face meeting is to bring teachers together to look at the Marking and Moderation of GCSE NEA 1 and 2 and/or H&C Unit 2 NEA. It is also an excellent opportunity to network with other teachers within your area. Please note: The exam boards that are included are: This is a community style meeting, which is less formal and more self-help than our other training days. As there are over 50 regional meetings, the Food Teachers Centre team try to attend as many as possible, but we cannot attend them all. To ensure that people get the most effective help we can provide, you will have access to an informative video presentation prior to the meeting. Your host will also receive a video to recap the key points and activities for the meeting.

Please remember these need to stay confidential throughout the process, as these are live projects. Note: You do not need to have completed the NEA process in school or finished marking to attend. I have found some really useful resources - including presentations on things to check when marking the NEAs and the evidence which the moderators want to have clearly marked.

NA,Sold out,Contact the organiser to request a refund.,"Note: bring a journal/pen I am a certified Therapist & Coach taking a holisitc & somatic approach to healing & self-development as well as anxiety, stress relief and depression recovery support. I specialise in inner child, trauma and attachment wound healing and subconscious repgrogramming. I am dedicated to support and empower you to transform anxiety, fears and limiting beliefs so you can step into your true, authentic self with love, trust & courage. Take time out for ‚ÄòYOU‚Äô to access inner peace, find a deeper connection and help regain a sense of control and clarity over any emotional struggles, challenges and/or life transitions. You will experience a full session of deep, conscious connected Breathwork to regulate your nervous system, facilitate mind and body healing, release suppressed emotions and/or unresolved trauma, relieve anxiety, stress, depression, and rebalance and reenergise the body. It will help restore safety and trust in the body and mind, and hold space for an emotional releases and somatic movement (e.g. tapping). It will also include coaching and therapy tools and practices to learn and take away with you. The Breathwork session will be made of 2 parts: 1st half is active, transformational, deep belly breathing and long breath holds . It will discharge the Sympathetic nervous system, remove excess cortisol, facilitate healing and offer emotional release. Breath holds increase CO2 tolerance which increases O2 in body, alkalises blood, teaches trust and accesses deep inner peace. 2nd half is slow, conscious connected breathing to regulate and rebalance nervous system, teach it to feel safe again and sync up heart with rest of body. Allow you to access deep relaxation What will happen in the Workshop? 1. You will learn the science behind Breathwork and understand how it is your internal medicine to manage and relieve any emotional and mental struggles such as anxiety, stress or depression. 2. You will learn how to set intentions in an effective way and we will call upon these at the start of the Breathwork and seal in the cacao ceremony at the end. 3. We will do some therapeutic self-development work around anxiety, specifically around transforming your relationship with anxiety (I go into this deeper in the 'Transform your Relationship with Anxiety workshops). There will be some journalling questions to help you bring conscious awareness and compassion to the subconscious thoughts and limiting beliefs driving the feelings in the body that are driving the unhealthy and unwanted patterns of behaviours, habits, choices and responses. 4 . You will learn and takeaway tools and daily practices to help challenge and reframe the negative thoughts and 'untruths'., with your truths. 5 . As you start to challenge your thoughts with your truths, you will create some powerful affirmations that we will weave into the Breathwork session and I will teach you some simple tapping (eft) to combine this with. 5. You will experience a full deep session of Breathwork which will be carefully curated to offer you the space and somatic support for any emotional release. I will encourage sound and movement and guide you through your journey. 6. You will tap into the power of your breath and use it to connect, regulate your nervous system, enter theta brainwave state where healing and change work can happen, access inner peace, cultivate acceptance, trust, love and compassion for yourself 7. After the Breathwork your body and mind will be in an optimal state for some meditation 8. We will end the workshop with a short cacao ceremony to seal intentions, share experiences if you feel like it and have a final release and celebration with some movement/dance You will take away practices and tools to help manage and alleviate daily anxiety symptoms, build resilience and continue restoring safety and love for yourself to live life with joy, love and courage and be everything you're meant to be, not who you 'think' you're supposed to be. You will start regaining control of the mind, reframing toxic thoughts, unlearning limiting beliefs and generating healthier, truthful, empowering thought structures. The key to healing is within our subconscious mind as well as our body supplemented by the right support, enough self-compassion and courage to take personal responsibility. NOTE As we breath deeper and faster we enter the theta brainwave state (hypnotic/dream like state) where the subconscious mind is most open and receptive to change. This offers you the opportunity for some powerful healing and self-development work W hen we function from fear - we lose sight of our true self and fail to meet our own needs, seeking validation, approval and safety from external sources. What trumps fear? Love. When we choose to be more loving, kind and compassionate with ourselves, we can allow ourselves to feel, heal, grow and evolve into who we are meant to be with courage, purpose and passion. ---------------------------------------------------------------- I am humbled to take you on this healing and self-development journey. It will b e 1.5 or 2 hour nourishing & empowering experience to honour your feelings, learn how to love yourself, control your mind, heal your body and upgrade your life. You will leave feeling empowered and more connected with yourself to regain control of the anxiety to continue cultivating a healthier relationship with it.

You don‚Äôt need to take these classes in any particular order and it‚Äôs no problem if you miss a week or attend irregularly. This is a traditional Lindy Hop class, meaning you will have to choose at the start of the class whether you want to learn the ‚ÄúLeader‚Äù role or the ‚ÄúFollower‚Äù role. We encourage all our students to try both roles, because they are both fun in different ways. At the start of each class the teacher will ask you to choose the role you would like to dance today. You can always choose the other role next time! All our classes are gender-neutral. Cancellation Policy: Due to administrative costs and the small capacity of our events, all bookings are non-refundable. If you cancel your booking more than 48 hours before the event, we can give you the balance as a credit to your account or in your name to use for a future event. Alternatively, if you contact us more than 48 hours before the event, we can transfer your booking to another person you name.

Please seek advice from your GP if you have any concerns prior to attending our session. Two new studies published in Current Biology suggest our brains are evolutionarily programmed to respond to rocking. Research also provides insight into why rocking is calming to babies. The brain wave synchronization occurs much easier through a rocking motion and allows the baby to feel more at home (i.e. it feels closer to being in the womb). And let‚Äôs not forget that we spend the first nine months of our lives being gently rocked in an amniotic sea. ‚ÄúSince immemorial times we‚Äôve rocked our babies, and often ourselves, to sleep,‚Äù says lead author on the new paper, Konstantinos Kompotis, at the University of Lausanne, also in Switzerland. ‚ÄúOur study provides new insights into the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.‚Äù Dr Michael J Breus, a Certified Sleep Specialist, states that it‚Äôs the simplest of soothing, sleep-inducing remedies, something we all naturally do: rocking a baby gently to sleep. But why does it work? How exactly does a gentle rhythmic motion change the sleep architecture of the brain? Repetitive motions, like those experienced in the gentle rocking of a hammock, can soothe anxiety. Dr. Herbert Benson, founder of Harvard‚Äôs Mind/Body Medical Institute, recommends repetitive movement to elicit your body‚Äôs relaxation response. This reaction allows a lower heart rate, blood pressure, and muscle tension. The gentle rocking of a hammock will boost brain wave oscillations associated with better sleep and has been shown to provide a fertile ground for deep relaxation. More specifically, the rocking fortifies the brain waves that are naturally present during sleep which help maintain deep relaxation. Neuroscientist Laurence Bayer of the University of Geneva in Switzerland, likens the findings to our intuitive appreciation that a slowly rocking hammock can relax us and do wonders for our mood. ‚ÄúThis is potentially a very promising avenue for future clinical research,‚Äù he notes. Rocking to sleep may have significant health benefits such as better quality of sleep and even improved long-term memory formation. We all instinctively know about the power of a soothing, repetitive rocking motion and this in combination with live ambient soundscapes and aromatherapy is a potent synthesis for deep relaxation. ""Words are inadequate to express the uniquely nurturing experience I had during your class... and the music was amazing! The feeling of being securely wrapped in a silk hammock from head to toe, suspended in the air, slowly rocking, with the gentle breath meditation, the crystal bowls and the ambient music created a sublime and profound atmosphere. It was as if I was in a cocoon of total support, allowing peace to flow into my entire being."" - Alison ""Being someone who is always on the move and finds it very difficult to relax, I found this session to be really valuable ‚Äòme time!‚Äô Initially, I found it difficult to let go and unwind where the muscles in my arms and legs were contracting. After a few minutes, I started to drift away into a soft slumber which was deeply relaxing. Despite this my senses were heightened and I became very conscious of the sounds that seemed to travel through my ears, vibrating all the way into my body. The gentle movements of the hammock with the music in the background made me feel like a young infant being rocked to sleep. A wonderfully calming and soothing experience, with the added bonus of not having to put in any physical effort. Great! I look forward to more of this."" - Navpreet Seth Newman: As a coach, Seth is dedicated to helping people calm, empower and rejuvenate their busy minds and bodies to achieve the best versions of themselves.

We live in a hectic world where women are expected to live and work like men. It is no wonder so many of us have menstrual cycles which are unbalanced and stressed, creating challenging physical, emotional and mental experiences. We all need an oasis of female well-being and restoration at some time in our hectic and busy life! This session is a gentle and relaxing hands-on healing sequence given by a trained Moon Mother who focuses the Divine Feminine energy used in the Worldwide Womb Blessing in a series of hand positions on the three main female energy centres (different to the chakra system) and on specific energy points on the female body that relate to the energies of the four female archetypes. The session will aid in: -Replenishing depleted archetypal energy centres so we feel whole and comfortable with all aspects of our self. -Helping to harmonise the flow from one archetype / phase to the next so we flow gracefully through the changes of our cyclic nature, whether in association with the menstrual cycle or the lunar cycle. -Energising the three main female energy centres, including the womb energy centre, bringing feelings of wholeness, stress relief and being centred, safe and empowered within our femininity again. -Clearing blocks that restrict our archetypal energies so that we live a richer version of our femininity, accessing the creativity, sexuality, intuition, clarity, wisdom and spirituality that lies in our authentic nature.

Holly has also been working on a collage series for the newly opened Ember Locke in Kensington, so make sure to pop in and have a look at the work made specially for their swanky stage area. Each session begins with a collaborative exercise to get those creative hands and minds warmed up, before entering the hour long collaging free flow. Experimentation, playing and sharing is encouraged. Materials, scissors and glue are all provided, but feel free to bring along your own mags if you like!

NA,Sold out,Contact the organiser to request a refund.,"Begin your journey into London's history at London Metropolitan Archives. The Unforgotten Lives exhibition presents the stories of Londoners of African, Caribbean, Asian and Indigenous heritage who lived and worked in the city between 1560 and 1860 and are recorded in London‚Äôs archives. Exploring a range of experiences from the pages of the extraordinary manuscripts, prints and maps in our collections, these multi-layered stories speak of love, enterprise, wealth and family life; discrimination, hardship, resilience and resistance. Informed by an ongoing research project which aims to reveal London‚Äôs complex and long-standing diversity and developed in partnership with Northeastern University London, the exhibition presents evidence of presence and community in a range of incredible documents created nearly 500 years ago. It celebrates well known figures from London‚Äôs past and introduces some of the thousands of names discovered in the archives. Olaudah Equiano, a key figure in the movement to abolish slavery and member of the Sons of Africa, features with his daughter Joanna. The London life and family of Ellen and William Craft is documented, following their extraordinary escape from enslavement, and a manuscript voting record of Ignatius Sancho from 1774, believed to be the first time that a person of African heritage voted in an election in Britain, is displayed for the first time at London Metropolitan Archives. We also meet many less familiar Londoners discovered by the research project including Katherine Auker, who successfully petitioned to be released from her enslaver in 1690. A man from Bengal known as John Morgan who escorts a cheetah to London in the 1760s and Prince Dederi Jaquoah who was baptised in the City of London in 1611.The archives also tantalisingly reveal what may be the identity of the servant of Sir Joshua Reynolds, who appears in several of his iconic paintings. Immersed in hundreds of years of London‚Äôs archives, Unforgotten Lives reveals glimpses of some of the 3300 people discovered by the research project to date, presenting their stories and their importance in the history of London. A complimentary art exhibition is now on display at London Metropolitan Archives from Monday 4 December until Wednesday 27 March. Admission is free. Inspired by the stories in the Unforgotten Lives exhibition, artists Annie-Marie Akussah, Elyssa Rider, and Tara Jerome Bernab√© have produced five new artworks to bring their stories to life. Annie-Marie Akussah showcases three-dimensional artwork that uses archival maps and images of landscapes that Black abolitionist, Ottobah Cuguoano, would have encountered in Ghana, Grenada and England - to confront the unknown, the new land. Elyssa Rider presents oil portraits of Ann Duck, a young mixed-race woman caught up in a life of theft and assault who is eventually hung for her crimes; and an imagined Japanese merchant woman, to re-address the absence of East-Asian women in the archive. Tara Jerome-Bernab√© reimagines the lives and images of young Black servants who were enslaved and made to work in aristocratic families as ‚Äòhouseboys‚Äô. Their new woven painting hopes to start a peaceful and more natural connection to the individuals trapped in certain derogatory paintings of the sixteenth to eighteenth century. We invite you to explore these unique artworks and engage with the conversations they evoke.",0,0,GBP,London Metropolitan Archives,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-11T10:30:00Z,2024-03-11T16:30:00Z,Unforgotten Lives Exhibition,"An extraordinary exhibition presenting the stories of Londoners of African, Caribbean, Asian and Indigenous heritage from 1560 and 1860.",https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/unforgotten-lives-exhibition-tickets-690341659487,london

Food in Jamaica is influenced by all the different nationalities that settled there - Irish, British, French, Asian, Spanish, American and African. Everyone wants to live in Jamaica because it is such a beautiful island! A lot of our ingredients come from other parts of the world.  I developed a passion for cooking, watching and helping my grandmother from the age of 8 years old. She was a great cook and baker. On Sundays, she would gather all of us, her granddaughters, to eat together. Rice and peas are one of our special Sunday meals. Our home was always full of people.  Even though we were poor, my grandmother was always feeding everyone. There were always people coming over to our house for my grandmother‚Äôs food. I remember the day she let me cook was one of the best days of my life. It really boosted my confidence, like I can do anything! Before leaving Jamaica, I used to cook from home and sell the food for a living. My food was very popular and I really enjoyed doing it.  When I moved to the UK, I worked in a Caribbean restaurant for many years. My coleslaw was famous at the restaurant! One day I would love to own my own Jerk centre and franchise it - like Nando‚Äôs.

NA,Sold out,Contact the organiser to request a refund.,"I aim to create the nurturing, warm atmosphere of a campfire where we share stories of our days, of our lives, before returning home. Where we laugh about small things, about brave things and trying something new. Where we come together to make sense of life, to eke out creative time for ourselves in amongst busy commitments of work and family, or with other limitations. I create this atmosphere on a bedrock of wellbeing principles while also sharing creative writing techniques to help you express what is waiting to be said and develop confidence in your own unique voice. What will we actually do? We will write together in response to prompts and exercises I bring to the group. These could be objects, pictures, or poems. Sometimes we will try to write a form of poetry or learn more about stories and how they are made or enjoy inventing characters. Sometimes we will do freewriting and write memories that come up. And sometimes we will play games together such as versions of consequences or collaborative poetry or use more creative methods such as found poetry, mapping or drawing. I will gently guide you step by step and give you plenty of encouragement. You will always be able to choose what to write about. How many people are in the group? The groups are small, with a maximum of 10 people, but often fewer than this.  Do I have to read out my writing? I encourage sharing by either reading out all of what you've written, a line or two, or by saying something about the process. One of the reasons people love coming to workshops is to hear the stories and words from others as they are all so different. It also helps you develop confidence in your unique voice.

Follow clues and solve puzzles to put the pieces together... Are you ready to step into the dark alleys and uncover their sinister secrets? Let's play a real-world adventure!

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

Singing roots us; it connects us to ourselves and when we do it in a group, it connects us to others. This singing circle for home educated children, young adults and parents/carers offers a moment each week to sing together. Singing can be empowering, uplifting and moving. It can also be nerve-wracking, scary and unknown. Our singing circles aren't about judging yourself, or being perfectly in time or in tune. They're about trusting yourself just enough to give it a go, for the pure enjoyment of it.    Join me in this singing circle where we will find a moment to take a breath, connect with ourselves and feel our feet on the ground, before we sing together in harmony. Don't worry if you have never done this before, or it sounds daunting - I will be teaching all the parts by ear and will support anyone who needs it. We sing a range of songs in harmony; some old, some new, some fun and uplifting and others slower and more relaxing. Whatever we're singing, the main aim is to have fun! So come and give it a go.... The Village hall is next to some beautiful woods which, when the weather is warm/dry enough, we may also venture into to sing amongst the trees. What could be better than singing in harmony? Singing in harmony out in nature! Please note: Whilst the circle is aimed at older children,  younger children are welcome to join the circle and sing, or can just be in the space and soak it all in.  If you have any questions, please get in touch and I will do my best to answer them.",0,11.55,GBP,Jody Vyner,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-12T14:00:00Z,2024-03-12T16:00:00Z,Singing Roots home ed. weekly singing circle,A capella singing circle:  heart-warming songs to light up the afternoon.

At the present time, many of our events are delivered online via the Zoom video conferencing programme, which we find suits everyone‚Äôs needs for when we cannot deliver traditional face to face venue events. Both Eventbrite and Zoom are easy to use with a few simple pointers. We strongly encourage individual Councillors to sign up for an event via the Clerk to the Council. However, when that is not possible, please check with your clerk before booking your own place. There are two sections that need to be completed. One is the ‚Äúticket buyer‚Äù - this is the Clerk or Responsible Finance Officer. Invoices are generated automatically from the site, so you should know what is payable to KALC immediately. You should insert the name and contact details of the Clerk/RFO here so they receive our invoice at once. KALC no longer sends out invoices for Training and Events. The second section refers to the ‚ÄúAttendee‚Äù. This is for the individual who will be attending the event. It is particularly important that the email address for that person is entered and is correct as this is where all joining instructions will be sent. Do double check the form before you hit the ‚ÄúSend‚Äù button. If all your details are correct, you will receive a notification via Eventbrite (not KALC) one week before and again within 48 hours of the event that informs you of: We also provide contact details so that if you encounter any issue on the day, we can help you as much as possible. That should mean that you get the best outcome from attending one of our courses or conferences.

NA,Sold out,Refunds up to 7 days before event,"Certificate: Course Completion Certificate Language: English Duration: 2 Days Credits: 16 Course Delivery: Classroom/ Virtual Live / Onsite Course Description: This business process improvement course provides you with an opportunity to learn the essential knowledge and skills for applying the most effective and current business analysis techniques when modeling your business, comprehensively analyzing the current state, and subsequently designing the future state. The application of these techniques will be presented as part of an overall framework, as you identify key deliverables and the major steps from modeling and analysis of the current state and future state design. Course Outline: Develop the Process List Every workplace contains business processes, however not all business processes are documented. This section focuses on how to develop a process list. After identifying the business processes, decision-making tools are practiced to consider what is important to the business. These tools include using prioritization and weighting criteria to make decisions based on business needs. Finally, you will discover how to gain support and buy-in from key stakeholders. Define the Scope Identifying the scope of the business process is critical for defining the boundaries of the project. In this section you will learn how to identify and document the boundaries of the business process that needs to be improved. Discussion and consideration of overcoming scope creep problems is also reviewed regarding the business process. Finally, you will determine what approvals are necessary before moving into a detailed business analysis. Draw the Process Model Process modeling ensures an understanding of the business processes being analyzed. In this section, you will learn the basics of process models, standard charting shapes, and the various levels used to draw business processes. Both visual models and text are practiced in this section to ensure an understanding of the current state, as well as review who needs to be involved in this step. Estimate Time and Cost Estimating time and cost for the current state involves analyzing process and cycle time, as well as existing costs to provide a return on investment. Examination of how to determine time and cost estimates for the current state is provided in this section, as well as the specific types of costs to analyze for potential business process improvement. Validate the Process Model Reviewing and confirming your analysis of the current state is critical before identifying potential improvements for the desired future state. This section focuses on the correct sequence to perform the validation steps with the project stakeholders. After validation is completed, improvement targets can begin to be identified. Apply Improvement Methods Now that the current state has been validated, the course focus begins to shift toward the future state. This section includes applying multiple techniques for proposing changes to the future state by using an extreme visual model. A process is followed to apply six improvement methods to ensure effective analysis work has been applied. Upon completion of analyzing what to improve, you will draw the process model for the proposed future state. Establish Controls & Metrics Adding controls to the business process ensures accuracy, reliability and can reduce errors. In this first part of the section, you will identify controls necessary for the future state. Establishing metrics helps ensure effectiveness, efficiency and adaptability of the business process. The second part of this section will help you distinguish which metrics will help evaluate whether the improved business process will work as you planned. Test the Process Testing the new or improved business process helps to identify bottlenecks, as well as work out bugs, defects and/or errors. Testing also helps ensure the process meets stated goals and provides for smooth implementation of the business process. This section will help you identify what needs to be included in testing the proposed future state. Evaluate Change Readiness During the analysis process it is critical to consider what the business is trying to accomplish. Evaluating change readiness helps to create strategies for minimizing the change impacts on the workplace, the workers, as well as avoiding distractions. This section examines change impacts, resistors to change and how to create an implementation plan for the changes identified to the business process. Perform Continuous Improvement Continuous improvement is an ongoing effort to enhance products, services or processes. This section focuses on how to monitor a business process and make adjustments as necessary so the business process repeatedly gets better over time. You will learn how to use different root cause analysis techniques to improve business processes and how to put together a continuous improvement plan. Finally, you will monitor data to identify and rank performance problems once the business process has been piloted.

You‚Äôll be guided through a series of sensory exercises designed to develop a deeper connection with nature, calming body and mind, before we conclude with a guided relaxation. During the session your Forest Bathing+ Guide will share some of the science that shows why time with trees is so good for us, including research into the surprising secret benefits of breathing woodland air. Our main aim, however, is to help you unwind. Slowing right down and focusing on nature allows us to step away from our busy minds, letting worries and cares melt away. We experience the natural world in a different way, perhaps like a child would, seeing things in more detail, with clarity and awe. You'll never look at woodland in the same way again! We are looking forward to sharing the restorative power of nature with you! Since its foundation in 2018 by Gary Evans and Olga Terebenina, guides from The Forest Bathing Institute have led hundreds of Forest Bathing+ sessions for thousands of people. We know it works from the transformations we have witnessed. Science backs us up: there is a vast and ever-growing body of evidence showing the potential benefits of forest bathing from normalising blood pressure and reducing stress, to improving sleep and enhancing immune function. TFBI itself is heavily involved in research with numerous universities across the globe, and studies have shown that our Forest Bathing+ sessions boost mood and nature connection, while reducing negative emotions such as depression and fatigue.

Our classes are a safe place to leave the pressures of your day behind, relax, and find stillness. What to expect: We start the classes with a short body awareness session, using gentle motion and movement designed to help you get out of your head, calm the mind and prepare you for the sound session. During the sound session, you will be invited to lie on the floor with nothing to do but listen to the sound of the Tibetan Bowls; the frequencies and vibrations of the bowls will relax you and help still your mind, and you may even find yourself drift off to sleep during the session.  If you prefer to sit in a chair, we have chairs available. Once we finish, we don't recommend rushing off to do lots of errands or go out all-night clubbing ;) You may find yourself energised, but, for most people, you'll probably be ready for bed after you leave! Who is the session suitable for: The session is suitable for complete beginners, as well as those with more experience; we welcome you wherever you are in your journey with sound. The sessions are not normally suitable for people with seizures, epilepsy, heart conditions or early stages of pregnancy but get in touch with us before you book and we can address any concerns on an individual basis. What to wear: Wear loose, comfortable clothing; leggings, joggers or even pyjamas :) We also recommend removing necklaces or bracelets, Apple watches, or other Bluetooth tracking devices. What to bring with you: Bring a yoga mat, blanket, socks, cushions, or pillows. We want you to be warm and cosy, so bring as much as you want to be comfortable lying on the floor. If you prefer to sit on a chair, we have chairs available, and we still recommend a blanket, socks and cushion for your back and feet so that you stay warm and cosy during the session. Cancellation Notice: All classes can be cancelled and fully refunded 24 hours before the class time. If you aren‚Äôt able to attend within 24 hours of the class, get in touch with us and, although we can‚Äôt guarantee this, we may be able to transfer your booking to a future class. About your sound practitioner: Karen Skidmore Karen Skidmore is a Level II Sound Practitioner and specialises in playing Tibetan bowls and bells. She was first introduced to sound healing when she was recovering from burnout and struggling with peri-menopause symptoms. Being told that she needed to rest more and maybe even try meditation was hard; she just wasn‚Äôt into any spiritual woo-woo! But her first experience of sound healing was instant relaxation. Karen loved the sounds and vibrations and couldn‚Äôt believe how easily she switched off. Over the coming months, these sessions helped calm her nervous system. They made such a difference to her health and well-being that she decided to study the practice and qualify as a Level II Sound Healing Practitioner in 2022, and is currently training as an Embodiment Facilitator. Whether this is your first time exploring sound healing or you‚Äôve been attending sessions for a while, we hope you will join us for one of our sessions soon.

Whether you are curious about constellations or have previous knowledge, this group provides a safe space to explore , together.  MÔªøonthly in-person drop-in group SÔªøecond Tuesday of the month Time: 19:00:00 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time) Location: Common Lane, Laughton, BN8 6BY Constellations are known as an effective process for providing a lens through which we can attend to our family and other personal relationships. Structural Systemic Constellations	  (Syst ¬Æ) extend the classic family constellation approach, incorporating new  methods.  This is an exciting and fresh approach to exploring and working with a broad range of relationship and 'life' issues, including professional or organisational issues, illness or physical symptoms,  struggling to say 'no', self image, lack of fulfillment, discontentment, to name but a few. Constellations complement well other exploration and personal development (personal reflection, conversation, therapy, coaching). What unfolds in a single session is often freeing, sometimes surprising, often moving.  The focus of constellations is on the individual in the context of their 'system'. Much like in the solar system there are a myriad of different interconnected elements and forces at play for each of us within our very own and unique system. Through constellations, significant events that have impacted on the system and its web of relationships can be explored. Underlying and sometimes unseen dynamics operating within the individual's system can become apparent. Then, with greater clarity of the system and its forces, work towards resolving entanglements and blockages within the system is undertaken. Positive change often follows.  What you may want to bring to constellations work:- In more detail ‚Äì how constellations work The constellations process examines the connections between different elements of a system. These can be people, important events, beliefs, family mottos or themes such as 'sickness' or 'failure'. Anything of significance within the system.  The client (issue-holder) is supported to create a spacial representation of the different elements in their system. Group participants are chosen as representatives for the different elements. The opportunity for clients to observe and experience this spacial representation of their system generates valuable perspectives; further information is elicited as each representative feeds back the experience of their position. The phenomenon of the representatives' experiencing in their positions is indeed a strange one. There is no scientific explanation for this but the accuracy of the representatives' feedback from their positions within the system is often astounding. Through this process it can become possible to locate the origins of difficulties, unfinished business and matters which require attention. Some issues within the system can relate to past events which still have ramifications now. This too can be explored. Through a variety of facilitated symbolic processes steps towards a better functioning system are taken, including separation from entanglement and handing back of burden and responsibility. From a more autonomous position healthier engagement with the elements of the system can follow. The impact on the client is usually freeing, with issues more resolved and clients feeling lighter. Sometimes when a situation is stuck, issues may not move towards immediate resolution. However, even then this can be experienced as liberating. The act of observing stuckness in this way in itself can create movement. Participating in a constellation as a representative and / or observer Constellations need issue-holders and they need representatives. Participating is this way is not only an opportunity for serving others. Each time there is also an opportunity for personal learning, for insight and an experience of shared humanity. Participants often comment on how rewarding the experience is. The same goes for observers. Depending on the size of the group some participants will be observers in the holding and witnessing circle. Just as important and equally rewarding. It is possible to attend a constellation group as a one-off session. Many make it a regular practice. Affordable and accessible for all The intention is for these sessions to be affordable and accessible for all. PÔªølease note the nominal booking fee for this event via Eventbrite. This mostly covers hire of the group room. There will be an opportunity to contribute with a cash donation on the day if this feels right for you. Any such generosity will be accepted with gratitude. Please read the following advisory information before booking A prerequisite for constellations is robust mental and physical health. Constellations are an invitation to participate in a potentially transformative process which can be intense, unfamiliar and challenging whilst of course held in a supportive space. The invitation and expectation is that you take responsibility for yourself and your needs, how you are participating and 'owning' your experience. If the above description of constellations sounds potentially overwhelming for you or if you have significant emotional challenges that you feel may be exacerbated by this kind of process, then I advise not to enroll. Constellations are not psychotherapy or counselling and cannot replace these. It can be helpful to support psychotherapy or counselling with parallel constellations and I would advise to discuss this with your therapist/counsellor.  By booking you declare you understand the above and are taking full responsibility for your own thinking, feeling and actions.",10,10,GBP,Andrea Dechamps,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-12T19:00:00Z,2024-03-12T21:00:00Z,East Sussex Family and Systemic Constellations  -  monthly drop-in group,"Join us to explore issues affecting your life - relationships, health, work and more, with a focus on gaining clarity and towards resolution",https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/east-sussex-family-and-systemic-constellations-monthly-drop-in-group-tickets-744853796757,london

3 hours 30 minutes,Mobile eTicket,No Refunds,"Join us for a double bill screening: Not A F***ing Horror Story is a feature length documentary following 35-year old Otto through a period of change, as he makes his film. It's driven by a moment of realisation for Otto. He's recently experienced bereavement and family health scares that have forced him to think about mortality for the first time - his own and those closest to him. Otto has always turned to films to make sense of the world and this moment is no exception. The Puppet Asylum is a 30-minute short film set in Victorian London. It's an allegorical horror biopic written and directed by Otto Baxter as a reimagining of his own life, from birth to becoming his own master. The unpredictable tale, straight from Otto's anarchic mind, charts Otto's birth as a horned baby in a blood-spattered morgue, through his wayward teens, to his years in captivity in The Puppet Asylym.

3 hours,Mobile eTicket,Contact the organiser to request a refund.,"How do diagrams relate to modern art? Are Modernist paintings and collages actually diagrams? How do we tell the difference between what is and isn't a diagram? What makes something a diagram? Using practical exercises and examples from Cubism to Surrealism, from Picabia to Kandinsky, from colour wheels to isotypes, we will explore these questions and ways that these questions might enable us to experiment with the diagram. The session will draw upon the below quotes: The theorum of Pythagoras is proved by a diagram. Leonardo's drawings of light striking a sphere are diagrams, but the works of Mondrian, although made up of straight lines, are not diagrams because they are not done in order to prove or measure some experience, but to please the eye. They are cryptoblots or blots masquerading as diagrams. Kenneth Clark, 'The Blot and the Diagram' The metaphorical model of Cubism is the diagram: the diagram is a visible, symbolic representation of invisible processes, forces, and structures. A diagram need not eschew certain aspects of appearances: but these too will be treated symbolically as signs, not as imitations or re-creations.

A significant portion of our brain‚Äôs regular workload is spent responding to gravity and constant external stimulation. Our float tanks are designed to quiet that constant input, limiting environmental distractions and allowing your musculoskeletal and nervous systems to relax and reset as tension is relieved. Floating activates the para-sympathetic nervous system (our ‚Äòrest and digest‚Äô mode) and puts our sympathetic nervous system (our ‚Äòfight or flight‚Äô response) on standby ‚Äì allowing our body and mind to heal from the stresses of modern living. Studies show Floatation Therapy may help the following range of health issues: It‚Äôs also fantastic for experiencing deep meditation and relaxation, and even reaching an altered state of consciousness as well as inducing creativity. HOW OFTEN SHOULD I FLOAT? Like meditation or yoga, floating is a wellness practice, and as you practice, your mind and body will grow more comfortable in that space and begin to build on each experience. There can be a learning curve adapting to the new environment, research suggests floating at least 3 times before deciding if it‚Äôs for you. People feeling particularly overwhelmed in their personal or professional lives might elect to float once or twice a week, it is strictly a personal preference. HOW DO I PREPARE? Avoid caffeine and large meals a couple hours prior to your session. DO I NEED TO BRING ANYTHING? We provide all necessary items such as towels, ear plugs and a buoyant pillow. We also provide shampoo, body wash, conditioner and hair dryers for pre and post float showers. WHAT DO I WEAR? We recommend floating naked to really get the sensory deprivation experience, but users may use swimwear. HOW LONG IS A FLOAT SESSION? When you book an appointment you get 90 minutes. This allows for a shower before and after, and gives you 1 hour in the floatation tank itself; when your time is up the quiet and gentle filter system will start. HOW DO I FLOAT? Get in, sit down and lay on your back. The salt water will fully support your weight and you will float on the water. If you start moving around you can touch the sides or bottom of the pod with your hands to stay still. Now enjoy your blissful float. WHAT WILL I EXPERIENCE? You will be in silence and darkness, your body will feel completely weightless. It usually takes about 20 minutes to really calm down and let the mind empty out. Once you do, you'll begin to relax. Usually between 20-40 minutes you lose all feeling in your body and transform into a floating consciousness without form. WILL I FEEL CLAUSTROPHOBIC? You‚Äôre always in control of your environment. Our Cabin Tank has plenty of room for people of all sizes. You may even keep the door of our Pod Tank ajar if you prefer. WHAT IS THE WATER TEMPERATURE? The water is maintained at approximately skin temperature, around 35¬∞C. WHAT HAPPENS IF I FALL ASLEEP? Many people find the experience so relaxing they find themselves sleeping in the tanks. Due to the buoyancy of water your body will be unable to turn over while asleep. The worst that can happen is being awoken by a bit of salt water in your eyes. HOW IS THE WATER KEPT CLEAN? The water is fully filtered eight times between each float and treated with UV Light. The tank is also treated daily with hydrogen peroxide. WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER A FLOAT? You may want to take it slow after your float, so best to give yourself some time to relax afterwards without needing to rush off. Drink plenty of water and you will feel the benefits for a few days after your float session. I NEED SOME EXTRA SUPPORT Our aim is to make floating as accessible as we can. If you feel you need some extra support or have any concerns about your ability to float please tell us and we will be happy to discuss solutions with you.

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right?

The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials?

2 hours,Mobile eTicket,NA,"Due to popular demand this event will now be taking place in the Lecture Theatre. A lot has happened in the copyright field recently. In the EU, Member States have now transposed the DSM Directive 2019/790 into their own laws (often in some substantially different ways) and related litigation has begun, already generating referrals to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In parallel to that, there has been a steady flow of new EU legislation, including regulations - like the Digital Services Act and the AI Act - which are formally without prejudice to copyright rules, and yet will clearly define their meaning and scope of application going forward. In the UK, copyright case law does not (yet) appear to show an appetite for a divergence from the EU and CJEU approaches, with the latter's decisions remaining ""good"" even in a post-Brexit landscape. This talk will review the key copyright developments occurred over the past few months in the EU and UK, and identify emerging trends and open questions.

Our internal world drives our external world. Our ability to use our mind determines how well we can control our external realities. What you may not know is that our Minds have an identity. Creating an Identity of mind allows us to direct our external world intentionally. The language we use to run our lives is one dimensional, which creates needless limitations. Our minds work best in a multidimensional language. Learning how to access your minds resources correctly will enable you to create a life beyond who we desire to be. Our vocabulary, are words we use internally to motivate change, but instead of encouraging us, the imperfections in our speech and articulation restrict access to our minds. There is no synchronicity between the one-dimensional language in our speech and the 4 th dimension of the mind. If you‚Äôre not using the correct language of the mind, the mind disengages where we become confused. We don‚Äôt have the language to describe the life that we want in a way that the mind accepts, understands, and can utilise.

Britain‚Äôs crushing of the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt against Jewish immigration to and British rule in Mandate Palestine was at heart an administrative war by an Emergency State. Military search-and-sweep operations after 1936 played second fiddle to systemic (and systematic) politico-legal pacification of the whole country by undemocratic colonial government. The target was the people. Of the three variables determining victory or defeat in Palestine ‚Äì insurgent action, British counter-insurgency military operations, and the colonial Emergency State ‚Äì this Ealing HA talk argues that the last was the key to victory. The Arab revolt was a clash between disorganized insurgency versus well-organized colonial civil rule that drove forward pacification by collectively and legally punishing Palestinians. Powerful colonial legal-administrative structures won the battle, as will be discussed. Pacification of the population was more significant than the military suppression of rebellion. This started not in 1936, but in 1920 with the arrival of the first civil High Commissioner for Palestine and the establishment of collective punishment laws.",0,0,GBP,Ealing Branch of Historical Association,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-12T19:30:00Z,2024-03-12T21:30:00Z,Talk on ‚ÄòThe Arab Revolt in Palestine in the 1930s‚Äô,This talk focuses on British colonial counter-insurgency measures in Palestine in  the years 1936 to 1939,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/talk-on-the-arab-revolt-in-palestine-in-the-1930s-tickets-846245441897,london

The research of Robin Schuldenfrei (Courtauld Institute of Art) focuses on the history and theory of modern architecture. She is interested in broad questions‚Äîtheoretical and practical‚Äîof how discourses and practices of design are shaped by a given period‚Äôs own cultural and theoretical critique of its media and objects. Her work interrogates the ways in which architecture and its objects relate to other products of society‚Äôs design: to works of art, to the production of images, to media, and to technology. She is the author of Objects in Exile: Modern Art and Design across Borders, 1930‚Äì1960 (2024). The Socialist Anthropocene in the Visual Arts (SAVA) is a visual arts led interdisciplinary research project that challenges the West-centric discourses of the Anthropocene by asserting the constitutive role of the environmental histories of Socialism in the formation of the new geological age.

1 hour 30 minutes,Mobile eTicket,NA,"Histories of the post-Reformation Church of (and in) England are, as is well known, often incompatible with each other. Much of the relevant scholarly output of recent times has been taken up with trying to resolve existing contradictory interpretations of what, exactly, happened at and after the Reformation. The same ur-texts (Cranmer, Jewel, Andrewes et al.) are frequently cited as authorities by those who see the English Church in completely different ways. Likewise, political narratives that are technically about the same topic often focus on quite different things. It has never been easy to say exactly what we mean by terms such as 'puritanism', 'Calvinism', 'Laudianism', and so on. Consensus and agreement are, frankly, not expected or likely any time soon. But there have been similar divergences in the narratives compiled by those in the past who wanted to narrate overtly 'Catholic' accounts of the Long Reformation. Putting these alongside the better known 'Anglican' disagreements on such matters tells one something about both of them. Not least, it allows for a discussion of what we might take to be the 'Catholic' tradition in the Church of England.

1 hour 30 minutes,Mobile eTicket,NA,"The Bulgarian Cultural Institute London is pleased to invite you to an event with the translator Angela Rodel, winner, together with the great Bulgarian writer Georgi Gospodinov, of the prestigious international Booker prize. Angela Rodel will present the first English translation of the Bulgarian classic from the 20th century ‚Äì Vera Mutafchieva‚Äôs The Case of Cem.  Angela Rodel will be in conversation with writer Hannah Hutchings-Georgiou. It‚Äôs 1481, and as seen from the centers of power in Rome and Venice, the cultures of Europe are under threat from the expansion of the Ottoman Empire. When the exalted Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror dies, his eldest son, Bayezid, takes the throne. However, discontented factions within the Ottoman army urge Mehmed‚Äôs second son, Cem, a well-educated and experienced warrior, to oppose his brother‚Äôs ascension, igniting a ruthless power struggle and forcing Cem into long years of exile, a pawn for European rulers who are desperate to preserve the order they have imposed on the continent over the course of centuries. The Case of Cem, Vera Mutafchieva‚Äôs celebrated novel of court intrigue, maintains lasting resonance for being a personal exploration of emigration and loss set in the historical era during which the politics of the East and West were sketched out with utter clarity. These early lines of demarcation, as voiced through Christian and Muslim emissaries, greedy leaders, unflinching soldiers, and lyrical poets, have indelibly influenced the world as we know it today. Vera Mutafchieva (1929-2009) is one of the most influential Bulgarian writers of the 20th century and undisputedly the most prominent female novelist in the Bulgarian canon. A historian of the Ottoman Empire by training, Mutafchieva is known for her intricate historical novels that offer nuanced insight into the complex layers of Balkan history, with its Slavic, Ottoman, and Byzantine Greek threads. After the success of The Cem Affair in 1967, Mutafchieva shifted her energy primarily toward literary endeavors, writing 35 books that feature figures from Balkan history, ranging from Bulgarian tsars to the Byzantine princess Anna Komina. Mutafchieva‚Äôs works have been translated into more than a dozen languages and have enjoyed particular popularity in neighboring Balkan countries.Angela Rodel is a literary translator who holds degrees from Yale and UCLA. Nine Bulgarian novels in her translation have been published in the US and UK, and shorter works have appeared in McSweeney‚Äôs, Two Lines, Ploughshares, Words Without Borders, and elsewhere. She has received NEA and PEN translation grants. Her translation of Georgi Gospodinov‚Äôs Physics of Sorrow won the 2016 AATSEEL Prize for Literary Translation, while her translation of his novel Time Shelter was featured on The New Yorker‚Äôs list of Best Books of 2022 and won the 2023 International Booker Prize. Since 2015 she has served as executive director of the Bulgarian-American Fulbright Commission. Hannah Hutchings-Georgiou is a writer and the founding editor-in-chief of Lucy Writers. She edits all Arts sections (Art & Design, Books, Dance, and Creative Writing especially). She completed her BA in English Literature at Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge, and has an MA in Eighteenth-Century Studies from King‚Äôs College, London. She is currently writing up her PhD in English Literature at UCL and teaches undergraduate students in the department. She regularly writes for online magazines and platforms such as The London Magazine, The Arts Desk, The White Review, Burlington Contemporary, Plinth UK, The Asymptote Journal, Club des Femmes, Women: A Cultural Review and many others.

Food and wine provided. More details of the drop-in workshop will be announced nearer to the event. All materials will be provided.  Mark of Cane explores the impact of sugar on the African-Caribbean Diaspora, confronting the haunting legacies of the Industrial Revolution and the Transatlantic Slave trade. Bow Arts is delighted to present a solo exhibition by Kat Anderson, winner of the inaugural East London Art Prize. Anderson will premiere ‚ÄòLas, Fiya‚Äô (‚ÄòLast, Fire‚Äô), a fictional short film which uses the genre of Horror to explore the subjects of ancestral trauma, dispossession and the power in the return/retrieval. The exhibition is an immersive, audio-visual experience, centred around the new single-channel, fictional short film, and accompanied by new paperworks. Shot largely on an existing sugarcane farm in Jamaica, the film weaves historical methods of harvesting sugarcane and sugar production with the cinematic concept of the ‚ÄòOrigin Story‚Äô. The accompanying series of paperworks have been hand-made from the extracted by-products of sugarcane, produced as part of Anderson‚Äôs residency at UCL East, where a special cane crusher and boiler furnace will be used to extract materials for the paper-making process. In line with the larger project ‚ÄòEpisodes of Horror‚Äô, Mark of Cane questions the emancipatory potential of creativity, reclamation and listening to history. Sugarcane becomes a vessel, both narratively and materially, for an imaginative and impactful examination of colonial histories. The work invites conversations around the forced and coerced movements of Black African-Caribbean people, from slavery through to the Windrush generation and its subsequent scandal. Kat Anderson was the winner of the inaugural East London Art Prize in 2023. The winner of the prize presents the winner‚Äôs solo exhibition the following year. More on the East London Art Prize. Anderson‚Äôs film has been supported by funds from Arts Council England and produced with support from Spike Island, Bristol.

Vesuvius. She aims to suggest the sense of timelessness and solidity that architectural forms can convey, as well as their impermanence and vulnerability. Her works also look at the transformative effects of weather on the built environment.

This mindset allows you to embrace challenges, learn from failures, and continuously develop your abilities and skills. To improve your weaknesses and strengths, start by identifying them through self-reflection, feedback from others, or assessments. Then, set specific and achievable goals that align with your values and vision. Practice consistent effort, seek out learning opportunities, and hold yourself accountable for your progress.

NA,Sold out,NA,"Built as a wooden retreat at the far end of his garden in Stockholm in 1747 and serving as a focal point for his writing and otherworldly conversations, Swedenborg's lusthus (or summerhouse) has come to stand as an emblematic presence of his visionary legacy for over 250 years. Described as early as 1766 as ‚Äòa kind of temple, to which [Swedenborg] often retired for contemplation‚Äô with ‚Äòdim religious light‚Äô it has since been used as a shed for storage, a hideout for a gang of thieves, a house of repose, the site of musical performances and poetry incantations, and also as a filmic backdrop. Today it sits in Skansen, the Open-Air Museum in Stockholm, and is the only known building still standing commissioned by the author himself. Drawing on rare items from the Swedenborg Collection and showcasing newly commissioned photographs by Bridget Smith and Anonymous Bosch plus other installed works by John Christie, Mark Riley, Ben Wickey and others, this exhibition explores the unique conditions of this enigmatic eighteenth-century building and the broader question of the relationship between place, dwelling and visionary states. The exhibition is curated by the Society‚Äôs Museum Director Stephen McNeilly and coincides with the launch of a new book of the same name. For more information on the new book please click here. ARNE BI√ñRNSTAD (1924-2012) was a writer and former museum curator of the cultural history department at the Skansen Foundation in Stockholm. In 1974 he received an award from the St Erik Association‚Äîan organization aiming to promote knowledge of the history of Stockholm and preserve the city‚Äôs culture and aesthetics. ANONYMOUS BOSCH is a photographer, cinematographer and filmmaker. He is known for his work on Sea Fever (2012), By Our Selves (2015) Aisling She√≤rais Mhicdh√≤mhnaill (George Macdonald‚Äôs Dreams) (2015) and The Whalebone Box (2019). JOHN CHRISTIE is a visual artist, broadcast filmmaker, and maker of artists‚Äô books. He has produced more than 20 limited editions for Circle Press and Objectif, and is a founding member of the award-winning East Anglian publisher Full Circle Editions. Alongside John Berger, he co-authored the award-winning book I Send You This Cadmium Red. MARK RILEY is an artist, writer, and senior Lecturer in Photography at the University of Roehampton. He has exhibited installation projects at the Manchester Metropolitan University, The APT Gallery and the Oxford House Gallery. He has also written widely on Heidegger, Tarkovsky and place. BRIDGET SMITH is a London-based artist represented by Frith Street Gallery. She has exhibited her work internationally, featuring in public collections in Austria, Spain, Mexico, the USA and the UK (including the V&A and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art).
