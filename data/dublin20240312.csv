Despre ""TUNETE"": Acțiunea filmului TUNETE se desfășoară într-un sat în vecinătatea căruia se află un câmp minat, rămas după conflictul armat din 1992. Doi copii din clase sociale diferite, Zinca și Victor, pe care îi leagă o prietenie interzisă de părinții lor, scapă vacile pe teritoriul minat și încearcă să le recupereze, intrând în zona restricționată. Astfel, câmpul minat devine un loc în care dispar prejudecățile și statutul social, lăsând loc doar pentru curaj, sacrificiu și… frică de tunete.Starring: Anatol Mîrzenco, Tincuța Josan, Daniel Brînză, Nicolae Cernomaz, Grigore Bechet, Olesea Sveclă, Boris Cremene, Mihaela Strâmbeanu, Andrei Golban, Marin Madan, Gherasim Crețu, Dumitrița Guvir, Victoria Cîrlan, Aurica Sclifos, Elena Chirilov, Eremia Loghin, Nina Grecu și alții.Written and Directed by: Ioane BobeicaCinematographers: Nicu Drăgan, Ioane BobeicaProduction Designer: Cristian CebanCostumes Designer: Victoria RotaruMusic by: Octavian CotețSound by: Roman BordeiEditor: Sergiu Barajin, Ioane BobeicaProducers: Marin Madan, Sergiu Cumatrenco, Anatol Mîrzenco, Ioane Bobeica, Marin CumatrencoExecutive Producers: Cristi Urîtu, Marin Madan1st AD & production managers: Vlada Jechiu, Ion BorșCameramans: Nicu Dragan, Ioane Bobeica, Alexandru PascalCamera Assistants: Adrian Gușan, Lucian SpataruLighting technicians: Dumitru Stegărescu, Petru Dragan, Vlad BragaRecordists: Sorin Mutelică, Marin CumatrencoFoley: Kseniya & Sergey Tarasiuk / Tarasyuk Records, KievAudio Engineers: Roman Bordei, Gigi Tabarcea, Mihăiță ChiriacRe-recording mixer în Dolby Atmos: Roman Bordei / YOUBESCVFX / Graphic Designer: Ian Onică / ACTIV STUDIOColor correction: Ilya CrestnicovProduction Design Assistant: David StavilaMake Up: Oxana SpineiPersonal Assistant for Mr. Cernomaz: Angela CechirlanTUNETE / THUNDERS is a production by ISGT GROUP and YOUBESC CREATIVE INSTITUTE (Moldova), BADEAMIC (Moldova), YOUBESC AYA (Romania); with the support of National Film Center from Republica of Moldova, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), UNICEF MOLDOVA.

2 hours,Refunds up to 7 days before event,"In this immersive masterclass on translating short stories, participants embark on a captivating journey into the world of literary translation. Led by literary translator, Gaia Baldassarri, the class focuses on the technicalities of translating short stories, a genre that requires skillful precision and cultural sensitivity. Through an exploration of diverse narrative styles, themes, and voices, participants learn how to convey the essence of the story while infusing it with richness and authenticity in the target language. The masterclass introduces participants to the tools needed to handle linguistic nuances and cultural references in a seamless manner. By honing their understanding of character development, plot structure, and literary devices, attendees are equipped to craft compelling translations that resonate with readers. Engaging in practical exercises, participants work collectively to refine their translation skills and develop their own unique style.  Whether you are an aspiring translator seeking to enter the world of literary translation or an experienced linguist looking to enhance your expertise, this masterclass promises to deepen your appreciation for the art of translating short stories and provide you with the knowledge and confidence to create impactful translations that transcend borders and cultures. T﻿ranslators working with any language pair are welcome. The session is delivered in English. It is only available to attend in-person. Short stories are brief, fictional narrative prose pieces that typically focus on a single incident, character, or theme. They are much shorter than novels, often only one or two pages long, and often centre on a single plotline or moment in the lives of its characters.  Short stories can be found in a wide range of genres and styles, and are known for their concise and compact storytelling, aiming to convey a complete and impactful narrative within a limited word count. The brevity of short stories allows writers to explore themes, emotions, and character development in an engaging way. However, balancing tone and style, cultural context and pacing with the brevity of the medium can make translating short stories more challenging than it might appear.  Before the masterclass takes place, attendees will be sent a short story which will be the focus of the workshop. Together, we will look at everyone's translations of the story. People who have signed up to attend will be sent a link to the story and to upload their translations before the session. These translations will be shared with everyone else in the group and serve as the basis for part of the masterclass. Gaia Baldassarri is a Dublin-based literary translator and visual artist. She holds a BA in Languages, Literatures and Intercultural Studies (Scandinavian and German studies) awarded by the University of Florence, and an MPhil in Literary Translation from Trinity College Dublin. Her translation interests include cultural specificity and dialects especially in contemporary Irish and Italian fiction.",30,30,EUR,Trinity Centre for Literary & Cultural Translation,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-12T18:00:00Z,2024-03-12T20:00:00Z,Translation Masterclass: Short Stories with Gaia Baldassarri,"Join Literary Translator, Gaia Baldassarri, for an interactive workshop on translating short stories",https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/translation-masterclass-short-stories-with-gaia-baldassarri-tickets-692342052717,dublin,NA

As a working class photographer from the North East, Tish felt an obligation to the people and problems within her local environment, and used documentary photography to highlight and challenge the social disadvantages she herself suffered. Unlike many social documentary photographers, Tish was from the same streets as the people she photographed, lending a poignant intimacy to her stark yet tender black and white images. However, despite early acclaim for her work, she was unable to make a living from photography and was unable to escape the poverty she documented. She died aged 56, her work relatively unknown. Tish’s brilliant eye, her unswerving ethics and constant empathy are present in her images, yet little is known of the artist herself. In this feature documentary we follow Tish’s daughter, Ella, as she opens up her mother’s archive for the first time on screen to reveal a treasure trove of unseen images, artefacts, letters and diaries. Ella takes to the road to meet people who knew Tish and ask why she did not receive more recognition in her lifetime. In digging into the past, Ella comes to terms with her own grief at her mother’s passing and reconnects with family members not seen in years. By shining a light on a working class artist who went largely unrecognised in her lifetime, the documentary questions the value placed on working class people both in the past and present day.",10.09,10.09,EUR,Jenny Keogh / THE DOCUMENTARY ROOM,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-12T20:00:00Z,2024-03-12T22:00:00Z,TISH (feature documentary),"A film about social documentary photographer TISH MURTHA, who photographed the working class communities in England in the 1970's & 1980's.",https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/tish-feature-documentary-tickets-846142273317,dublin,Sold out

NA,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

A club may appoint the same person to both the CCO and DLP positions however best practice advises that they are kept as separate roles. The third part of the ISC Child Welfare & Protection Training Programme is the Designated Liaison Person workshop. Every club/organisation should designate a person to be responsible for dealing with any concerns about the protection of children. The Designated Liaison Person is responsible for reporting allegations or suspicions of child abuse to TULSA Child and Family Agency or Social Services (NI) and/or An Garda Siochán / PSNI. It is recommended that this person is a senior club person. However, if there is difficulty identifying a separate individual to take this role, the Club Children's Officer can be appointed as Designated Liaison Person once the club/organisation is clear about the responsibilities of each role. The organisation's child protection policy and procedures should include the name and contact details of the Designated Liaison Person and the responsibilities attached to the role. The Sport Ireland Code has been adopted and implemented by governing bodies of sports, clubs, local sports partnerships and community/voluntary groups on an ongoing basis since 2000.

1 hour 30 minutes,NA,"Living Freedom ‘University Salons’ are for all students (and academics) keen to explore and debate ideas on the past, present and future of freedom. A short talk is followed by plenty of time for questions and discussion. Everyone is welcome to come along. TOPICFrom Hate Speech to Misinformation: Why Social Media is Not the Problem With digital culture and myriad forms of social media, each of us can share more information and opinions more widely than ever before. Today every individual has a personalised channel, social network and algorithms that shape what they want to see next. But many worry that productive exchanges of ideas have diminished, along with potential to develop a shared worldview and even a shared reality. New identity driven forms of polarisation, hate speech, online harms and fake news fuel fears that the very technologies that transformed communications are responsible for our descent into echo chambers, toxic filter bubbles and the demonising of those with whom we disagree. With Taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming incitement to hatred legislation is “not up to date for the social media age” many worry that a planned new hate crime law will have a grave impact on free speech. But to what extent are new digital technologies really the problem? After all, just over a decade ago, social media was celebrated for the power to share ideas and drive political change in the Arab Spring. In this talk followed by open discussion, Timandra Harkness explores both the new digital technologies and the new identity driven forms of culture and politics, and asks: how did we get here, why does it matter and where do we go from here? Instead of pointing the finger at the smartphone and new technologies, do we need to understand our own our shrinking sense of who we are and obsession with how others see us? --------------------- SPEAKER: TIMANDRA HARKNESSjournalist, writer and broadcaster; author, Technology is Not the Problem (2024)Timandra Harkness is author of Technology is Not the Problem (forthcoming, Harper Collins).

The book explores the relationship between the concept of design and the “Made in Italy” brand, highlighting the added value that both confer on everyday objects, furniture, clothing, jewelry, and automobiles that represent them. Vercelloni reconstructs the history of this Italian success, which merges artistic creativity, craftsmanship, experimentation, and industrial innovation. He highlights the humanistic aspect of design and traces the main stages that led to the great season of Italian Bel Design, from Ponti to Munari, from Castiglioni to Magistretti, from Sottsass to the most recent developments that see Italian designers collaborating with foreign designers in the name of Made in Italy. A comprehensive overview aimed at all types of audiences about the greatest designers and architects of our recent history. An opportunity especially aimed at students and enthusiasts of design and architecture. The meeting is part of the cycle “Style and Costume in Italy” and on the occasion of the “Italian Design Day in the World” to be celebrated on March 15th. Other events are scheduled during the week from March 11th to 18th in Ireland around the theme “Creating value, inclusivity, innovation, and sustainability.” Free admission.

NA,No Refunds,"We wanted to bring a fresh alternative to countless forms, contracts and hours of consultations. Matchmakers claiming they have thousands of daters, but none explaining from where. While other Matchmakers are forced to find your match at bars, the mall or other unsavory locations, we meet a fantastic set of new singles every week from our events alone, allowing us the opportunity to choose for you the best out of an already great crowd. We also garner extremely busy Matchmaking daters who find our services an efficient dating indulgence. Sought after for the level of dater we attract, the personal service we offer and an unparalleled selection of the daters you want to meet. We're honored to find that special someone just for you.  Consider us your blind-date specialists! Inspired by the romantic and simple days gone by, we bring back the lovely idea of meeting a date, arranged by another, at a venue of your choosing. All communication between you and your Date-Mate prior to your Date-Night will be entirely through us.  ~ Simplify Me! •	Two pre-arranged Date Nights. For Each Date-Night you will meet a different partner chosen for you based on your mutual aspirations, expectations and likes.  •	Matchmaking by our experienced team. A comprehensive and detailed approach to understanding you and finding that partner who compliments both of your goals.  •	Our team will discuss your details and preferences with you upon confirmation.  •	Arrangements for each of your Two Date-Nights at one of our preferred venues or venue of your choice.  •	Complimentary admission to Speed Dating events at no charge to you for the duration of your Matchmaking package.   €562 ~~ Date Me! •	Four pre-arranged Date-Nights.

Spoil yourself in our insight and unparalleled experience.  •	Complimentary admission to Speed Dating events at no charge to you for the duration of your Matchmaking package.  €892 ~~ What information is exchanged with my ‘Date-Mate’ prior to our arranged date? Prior to your arranged date, matched daters are only given each other's first names. After we consult with both daters, a night and venue is arranged with details of the venue, time and day of the meeting and the first name of your ‘Date-Mate’. Personal information such as e-mail, address or phone numbers are never exchanged by us and we urge our daters to use the same prudence. Are events included in my Matchmaking Package? Yes! A wonderful bonus to purchasing our Matchmaking Packages is the ability to attend our speed dating events at no additional charge to you. When you see an event you fancy attending - simply let us know and we'll add you to the guest list. There is no limit to the number of events you may attend with our compliments for the duration of your package. Attending events is an important part of the process and an excellent opportunity for us to get to know you better, for you to get to know our daters and for us to see who is drawn to you. As well, many Matchmaking daters find our events the perfect way to narrow down what they are looking for and learn a bit more about themselves in the process. How can you charge so much less than the competition?  We don't have to spend money recruiting daters. We are sought after for who we are and the level of dater we attract, affording us the luxury of daters finding us, rather than the expense of having to find daters. How do I let you know my preferences? After you select your matchmaking package, you will receive a confirmation e-mail with details and questions to help us find your Date Mate. Tell us as much as you like! The more you offer, the better we can match. Our staff will review your preferences and get to work finding your match, making arrangements and sending you off on your date night. Do I have to go to a venue or restaurant chosen by SpeedDublin Dating? Of course not! You are free to choose any restaurant, venue or event you wish for your Date Night. Simply let us know what you have in mind so we may pass the reservation details onto your Date-Mate. Am I obligated to use my Date Nights over a certain period of time? You may use your Date Nights at your leisure. What is the age range? Our Matchmaking age range is similar to that of our events; our daters tend to be between early twenties to early forties. What is ‘This, that and the other’?  Consider it our Concierge Service.  Let us know what you need – everything from fashion tips to relationship advice, to being well-groomed. We have all the perks! Let us make your personal appointments or dinner reservations at the venue of your choice or ours - whilst you enjoy the lovely treatment. What if I don't have the ability to act like a lady or gentleman?  Oh dear - how unfortunate. We do have a zero tolerance for any rudeness - of any sort. We attract such great daters but find - as in life - not every dater is ideal. Our daters are also our product and we go to great lengths to ensure everyone meets lovely daters. We want the right daters, not just any daters. Behavior short of lovely will result in a dater being banned from the company. This may upset some but we feel our daters as a whole appreciate the extra effort and we hope you do too.  ~~ To read even more about our Matchmaking Packages - Click Here!

What you may not know is that our Minds have an identity. Creating an Identity of mind allows us to direct our external world intentionally. The language we use to run our lives is one dimensional, which creates needless limitations. Our minds work best in a multidimensional language. Learning how to access your minds resources correctly will enable you to create a life beyond who we desire to be. Our vocabulary, are words we use internally to motivate change, but instead of encouraging us, the imperfections in our speech and articulation restrict access to our minds. There is no synchronicity between the one-dimensional language in our speech and the 4 th dimension of the mind. If you’re not using the correct language of the mind, the mind disengages where we become confused. We don’t have the language to describe the life that we want in a way that the mind accepts, understands, and can utilise.
