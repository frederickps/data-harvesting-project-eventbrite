En 2013, elle a été inscrite au titre des monuments historiques en reconnaissance de son architecture exceptionnelle, conçue par l’artiste lui-même. En 2020, la Fondation a également obtenu le label «Musée de France», qui garantit la qualité de sa politique de conservation, d’enrichissement et de présentation des collections. La Fondation Vasarely a développé des partenariats prestigieux pour enrichir sa programmation culturelle. Depuis plus de 4 ans, elle collabore avec le Centre Pompidou pour organiser une exposition unique, offrant un regard inédit sur l’art cinétique et l’art optique. La Fondation Vasarely abrite une collection exceptionnelle de Victor Vasarely. Les salles d’exposition de la Fondation offrent un cadre unique pour découvrir ces œuvres, qui jouent avec les illusions d’optique, les jeux de couleurs et de formes, et qui ont influencé de nombreux artistes contemporains. « A la base, il y a toujours l’original, la « pièce unique » mais il n'est plus permis de nous arrêter là et d'enfermer cette œuvre unique dans le cercle restreint des privilégiés. Au contraire ! Il faut œuvrer à partir d’elle, la recréer en d’autres fonctions, la centupler et la projeter dans les espaces du monde. » Victor Vasarely, « La sérigraphie, Arcay et la re-création », Aujourd’hui art et architecture, n°12, avril 1957 Ce sont en ces termes que Victor Vasarely présentait la sérigraphie en 1957. Le Plasticien souhaitait atteindre une démocratisation de l’œuvre, qui se traduit alors par le passage d’un prototype initial aux multiples, grâce au procédé de la sérigraphie. Les œuvres originales se déclinent ainsi en diverses programmations numérotées, accompagnées d’une gamme de couleur correspondante, avant d’être transformées en véritables sérigraphies, signées et numérotées. S’opposant à l’idée de l’œuvre unique et exclusive, Vasarely s’entête à reproduire celle-ci, dans le but de rendre l’art accessible à tout le monde, résultant dans un art multiple et identique en toute matière et dimension.",5,15,EUR,Fondation Vasarely,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-10T09:30:00Z,2024-03-10T16:30:00Z,"Admission générale - L art du multiple, Victor Vasarely et la sérigraphie",Venez découvrir le centre architectonique créé par Victor Vasarely,https://www.eventbrite.fr/e/billets-admission-generale-l-art-du-multiple-victor-vasarely-et-la-serigraphie-754523127987,marseille

Au programme de cette balade grottesque : une marche d'approche de niveau intermédiaire au départ de Callelongue pour attendre les 3 grottes du Rocher de Saint-Michel - grottes de l'Ermite, de Saint Michel d'Eau Douce et de l'Ours - avec dans chacune d'entre elle des surprises et des découvertes cavernicoles. Attention, ces lieux si particuliers ne sont pas facile d'accès ! On va devoir grimper, se hisser, se tortiller. Ca va glisser, suer, mouiller, salir aussi mais sûrement te ravir. Cette randonnée s'adresse donc à un public averti, qui a l'habitude de randonner sur des sentiers escarpés et qui dispose d'un équipement adapté(chaussures de marche, lampe frontale...).

Le nombre de places est limité pour pouvoir profiter en toute sécurité. Le tarif est libre et conscient. Et pour que cette sortie soit véritablement spéléo-artistico-naturaliste, je te propose, si le thème t'inspire, de ramener une création sur le thème des grottes, ce que tu veux (un texte, une poésie, un dessin, une photo...), à partager avec le reste du groupe.

You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials?
