Years ago, nine-year-old Rosalie Marshall‚Äôs disappearance tore her family apart. Now, sixteen years later, her mother Helena is found dead, her husband by her side. It looks like a straightforward murder-suicide but DS Maeve Kerrigan and DI Josh Derwent soon discover nothing about this case is straightforward. The Marshalls have been keeping secrets, but they aren‚Äôt the only ones, and someone is prepared to kill to hide the truth. And it‚Äôs down to Maeve to discover this truth before it‚Äôs too late. With tightly plotted mystery, psychological tension, brilliantly drawn characters, and twists and turns aplenty, Jane‚Äôs latest novel is bound to have readers on the edge of their seats.

In 2019, Cruel Acts was chosen as Irish Crime Novel of the Year at the Irish Book Awards. It was a Sunday Times bestseller. The Killing Kind was a Richard and Judy Book Club pick in 2021 and was recently adapted for Paramount+.

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

NA,Refunds up to 7 days before event,"‚ÄúPhase deep into the Night to break high into the Light‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe MIND is a product of its KNOWING, not its THOUGHTS nor its THINKING, for they are easy to be influenced by the external world, but the Mind which is internal, is NOT them‚Äù. Mind ReMapping You may read this today and wonder, what values can we learn from Mind ReMapping? Your Mind is an atomic and perpetual energy. Its power is so complex that it carries no mass, but yet, derives energy not only from the natural sustainability of surrounding environments, but it perpetuates far greater power with the connections it makes with other minds where at our collective nucleus, is a nuclear energy which is unstoppable. This power, which for most of us is dormant, inspires its own potent energies, deriving power from genuine and respectful gestures we gift through the interactions we have with one another, in the simplest of, ‚ÄúHellos, & how are you?‚Äù Its only through a connection with other minds, not money, nor possessions, that can pull us out of our lowest moments in life‚Äôs darkness, because nothing, not even FEAR, can survive the deep depths of Time, where FEAR abandons us to insanity or, we find salvation through a connection with other minds. However, the mind's energy when synchronised is unrivalled, as there is nothing more gargantuan than collective minds coming together because the mind must first perceive before it can conceive. Collective Minds that are empathic to one another are designed to create wormholes in Time, where either the greatest ideas are birthed, or where our worst nightmares are channelled through time. Wormholes in Time, of course, can be achieved in their singularities which can be truly exhilarating or horrific, but the wormholes we create together, open vaster passages in Time through which powers of Consciousness can manifest itself to us, in whatever we have asked it to become. That power to some, can present itself to be God, to some, it can be Spirituality, and to others, it can be the Sciences, the Arts, or any means where Consciousness can reach us through OPEN TIME. Imagine these wormholes as transmission gateways to higher or lower Dimensions, that for humans, are situated in the only place where Time can travel, whilst carrying our perceptions with it. That place is the 4 Dimensions of our Minds. At this point, we realise why our minds are so powerful because they are PORTALS of TIME, and why, we are often kept divided, pitting advantages against one another over trivial conflicts, because we have forgotten who we are. We are not aware we are lowering our status as a species which redirects Times energy toward alternative sources that close time, straining and weakening mind transmissions. However, what is being attempted above all our own primitive needs, is that certain Timelines of Consciousness are being fragmented. Consciousness is an intelligence of unities, where strength in numbers creates infinities which either, flourish in life, or instead, are infinities that perpetuate repetitive downward spirals. The next revolution is not going to be the takeover of A.I. as we are sold and told because it is too obvious, it instead, will be the invisible Decimations of minds only looking out for themselves, or it will be the Raptures of people who know their Minds, bringing Times of life, together.

Personal information such as e-mail, address or phone numbers are never exchanged by us and we urge our daters to use the same prudence. Are events included in my Matchmaking Package? Yes!

When you see an event you fancy attending - simply let us know and we'll add you to the guest list.

Attending events is an important part of the process and an excellent opportunity for us to get to know you better, for you to get to know our daters and for us to see who is drawn to you. As well, many Matchmaking daters find our events the perfect way to narrow down what they are looking for and learn a bit more about themselves in the process. How can you charge so much less than the competition?  We don't have to spend money recruiting daters. We are sought after for who we are and the level of dater we attract, affording us the luxury of daters finding us, rather than the expense of having to find daters. How do I let you know my preferences? After you select your matchmaking package, you will receive a confirmation e-mail with details and questions to help us find your Date Mate. Tell us as much as you like! The more you offer, the better we can match. Our staff will review your preferences and get to work finding your match, making arrangements and sending you off on your date night. Do I have to go to a venue or restaurant chosen by SpeedDublin Dating? Of course not! You are free to choose any restaurant, venue or event you wish for your Date Night. Simply let us know what you have in mind so we may pass the reservation details onto your Date-Mate. Am I obligated to use my Date Nights over a certain period of time? You may use your Date Nights at your leisure. What is the age range? Our Matchmaking age range is similar to that of our events; our daters tend to be between early twenties to early forties. What is ‚ÄòThis, that and the other‚Äô?  Consider it our Concierge Service.  Let us know what you need ‚Äì everything from fashion tips to relationship advice, to being well-groomed. We have all the perks! Let us make your personal appointments or dinner reservations at the venue of your choice or ours - whilst you enjoy the lovely treatment. What if I don't have the ability to act like a lady or gentleman?  Oh dear - how unfortunate. We do have a zero tolerance for any rudeness - of any sort. We attract such great daters but find - as in life - not every dater is ideal. Our daters are also our product and we go to great lengths to ensure everyone meets lovely daters. We want the right daters, not just any daters. Behavior short of lovely will result in a dater being banned from the company. This may upset some but we feel our daters as a whole appreciate the extra effort and we hope you do too.  ~~ To read even more about our Matchmaking Packages - Click Here!

There is no class on Wednesday 26th March (mid-term break) This course is a follow on from our beginners class and runs over  5-wednesday evenings. The course is suitable for those that have attended our standard beginners course with Nicola. The course is a development of previous learning to obtain your A2 certificate in Italian Language and Culture, a wonderful goal to pursue. The A2 Level in the Common European Framework signifies an elementary level of proficiency in Italian. By achieving this certificatation , you will demonstrate you r ability to understand and use every day expressions, interact in simple conversations, and provide information about familiar topics. Lesson Content Please note the 'Deposits, Missed Days and Missed Classes Refund Policy' below Italy has never been closer to Connaught as it is now, with many flights from Knock to Milan for ‚Ç¨9.99. This is the time to learn a new language and take that longed for trip to Italy. With our Italian Conversational for Beginners course you can now learn to order a meal, write, read and speak basic Italian within six weeks. Tutor Nicola has a Degree in Italian, but as she says herself, she found it very difficult to learn from an Italian speaker. 'They spoke too fast for me,' she said. 'I felt completely inept and thought there was no way I was ever going to pick up the language.' However, Nicola has structured a class where she teaches her students to learn the simple phrases needed to get you through a holiday or weekend away in Italy. 'I teach my students how to speak Italian in a fun way, that is, without having to delve through verbs and adjectives. That is something we can do in the more extensive course, but in Basic Italian, you just need to get through the ordinary day vocabulary. Nicola has travelled extensively in Italy and has also written novels set there.' Some reviews and comments from students that have attended Nicola's Italian classes here at LSA ""Ôªø Nicola is an excellent tutor. I joined the class with a few basic phrases and finished as a very confident beginner, she has encouraged us all the way, sending daily phrases etc. I definitely have enough Italian now to get by in a a holiday in Italy. Looking forward to the next level of classes starting and getting to learn more Italian"" ""NÔªøicola genuinely cares for her students and adds a a sense of fun to her classes. I'm looking forward to continuing my studies with her."" ""I am delighted to have successfully completed my Introduction to Italian with you Nicola. It‚Äôs amazing how much we can learn, as adults, when we have a conducive learning environment and competent teacher as yourself. Your teaching style was relaxed but far-reaching and has equipped me with the confidence to speak Italian at my upcoming break in Italy. The class content; a mixture of vocabulary, verbs, vernacular words and phrases for day-to-day travel, is a toolkit that will be invaluable to me. An unexpected touch was the inclusion of Italian Culture which really is intrinsic to an appreciation for the language and future travel.""

Forget small spaces, darkness, and spiders, standing up in front of a crowd and talking is far more terrifying for most people. Through this workshop your participants will become more confident and relaxed in front of an audience which will translate into a successful speaking event. Leading Effective Teams Training: This training based on leading teams will help you to develop anyone that leads a team or is involved in a leadership role.

Your participants will understand that training is a process where skills, knowledge, and attitudes are applied in a unique way. Presentation Skills Training: In a survey carried out amongst experienced, middle and senior executives, designed to determine the things that they feared most, public speaking came out as number one.

Practical Sales Skills Training: These practical sales skills training has been developed for salespeople or people who are required to sell as part of their role. This course is applicable for both people relatively new to sales as well as those who have a lot of experience as the content is flexible enough to adapt to suit the audience. Conflict Management Training: Disagreements, differences of opinion and conflicting perspectives on key issues inevitably arise in any context where people are working together.

Power Query and Power Pivot for Excel Training: Power BI (including Power Query & Power Pivot) are the biggest Excel news items in the last 10 years. They give Excel users the power to draw information out of multiple sources, link it together then perform calculations on it that can then be sliced & diced any way you want. Essential Management Skills Training: Every day, managers solve difficult problems, turn organisations around, and achieve astonishing performance. To be successful, every organisation needs good managers. Manager Management  Training: With this course, you will be able to provide the skills, guidance, and empowerment to your team of managers. They will then be better suited in leading and motivating their team and thus produce fantastic results. To be a successful manager means having a wide range of skills. Through this workshop, you will be able to disperse your knowledge and experience throughout your leadership team. Sales Presentation Mastery Training: Sales are the absolute most essential component of any business, and selling skills are the most highly valued skills in today‚Äôs business landscape. The world's fastest growing and most successful businesses have one thing in common: they have effective sales people that drive their business forward. Time Management Training: Personal time management skills are essential for professional success in any workplace. Those able to successfully implement time management strategies are able to control their workload rather than spend each day in a frenzy of activity reacting to crisis after crisis - stress declines and personal productivity soars! These highly effective individuals are able to focus on the tasks with the greatest impact to them and their organization.

What you may not know is that our Minds have an identity. Creating an Identity of mind allows us to direct our external world intentionally. The language we use to run our lives is one dimensional, which creates needless limitations. Our minds work best in a multidimensional language. Learning how to access your minds resources correctly will enable you to create a life beyond who we desire to be. Our vocabulary, are words we use internally to motivate change, but instead of encouraging us, the imperfections in our speech and articulation restrict access to our minds. There is no synchronicity between the one-dimensional language in our speech and the 4 th dimension of the mind. If you‚Äôre not using the correct language of the mind, the mind disengages where we become confused.

 a Republic in Ireland. While the native Irish Catholics suffered the brunt of British repression, the
 Presbyterians, although marginally better off, also suffered exclusion and marginalisation. The growing
 disaffection in Ireland was influenced by the French and American Revolutions. Belfast was the crucible of a
 rebellion that was stirred and ignited by the revolutionary ideals of the era and turned into popular agitation
 and then armed insurrection. The rebellion was plotted and carried out by the Society of United Irishmen,
 founded in October 1791, which was forced into armed revolt by the unsuccessful peaceful and democratic
 pleas for reform. The uprising cost the lives of over fifty thousand people including most of the prominent
 leaders, but created a legacy of Republican ideology that would inspire future generations.
