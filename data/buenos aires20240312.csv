Los 5Ritmos¬Æ Fluido, Staccato, Caos, L√≠rico y Quietud‚Ñ¢ son formas de Ser. Son un mapa para cualquier lugar al que deseemos ir y en cualquier plano de consciencia: hacia el interior y el exterior, hacia el frente y de regreso, en el nivel f√≠sico, emocional o intelectual. La secuencia c√≠clica de movimiento de estos 5Ritmos se llama Ola. A trav√©s del movimiento podemos acceder a su pleno conocimiento integr√°ndolo de tal forma que nos haga conscientes de cada estado que estamos atravesando en los procesos que vamos viviendo. La pr√°ctica de los 5Ritmos nos ense√±a que la vida es energ√≠a en movimiento, liber√°ndonos de las nociones fijas sobre personas, lugares, objetos o ideas. Los participantes podr√°n experimentar una liberaci√≥n de emociones o estr√©s lo que puede aportar mayor bienestar. ¬øC√≥mo funciona la pr√°ctica? Con ayuda de algunas pautas que gu√≠an el recorrido y con m√∫sica especialmente curada, nos sumergimos en un viaje sin interrupciones con un tiempo de transici√≥n adecuado para la exploraci√≥n de cada uno de los ritmos: Fluido, Staccato, Caos, L√≠rico y Quietud. Que tiene como destino final la conexi√≥n con la sabidur√≠a de nuestro cuerpo, el auto-conocimiento y el despertar de la conciencia. Finalmente, lo m√°s importante para mi es generar un espacio donde puedas seguir el impulso de tu cuerpo, comprometi√©ndolo por completo en movimiento, soltando las formas y conectando con el propio ritmo. Aqu√≠ lo perfecto es aut√©ntico. + INFO SOBRE LA PR√ÅCTICA: https://www.5rhythms.com/es/",6000,6000,ARS,Pr√°ctica de 5Ritmos¬ÆÔ∏è Con Brenda Cohen,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-12T22:15:00Z,2024-03-13T00:15:00Z,5Ritmos MARTES 12 MARZO,5Ritmos¬Æ es una pr√°ctica de auto exploraci√≥n a trav√©s del movimiento espont√°neo y la expresi√≥n aut√©ntica del ser.,https://www.eventbrite.com.ar/e/5ritmos-martes-12-marzo-tickets-846608497807,buenos_aires,NA

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

Dirigida con la caracter√≠stica sensibilidad y profundidad de Reichardt, ""First Cow"" sigue la historia de dos forasteros, interpretados magistralmente por John Magaro y Orion Lee, quienes se embarcan en un negocio de venta de galletas con la ayuda de una vaca lechera, la primera (y √∫nica) en el territorio. A trav√©s de su lente, Reichardt explora temas de amistad, ambici√≥n y la b√∫squeda de una vida mejor, todo ello ambientado en el impresionante paisaje del noroeste del Pac√≠fico. Kelly Reichardt, conocida por su enfoque minimalista y narrativas poderosamente sutiles, nos entrega una obra que es tanto una reflexi√≥n sobre el sue√±o americano como una oda a las peque√±as historias que forman la trama de la historia estadounidense.

NA,NA,"La Boca es un punto ineludible para todos los visitantes de Buenos Aires. Como cl√°sico barrio bajo y portuario de la ciudad, La Boca vio nacer en sus conventillos la magia del tango y en sus calles la pasi√≥n de los m√°s grandes clubes de futbol del pa√≠s: Boca Juniors y River Plate. La inmigraci√≥n, mayoritariamente genovesa, dot√≥ al barrio de un estilo √∫nico totalmente contrastante con la Buenos Aires de alta alcurnia de los barrios c√©ntricos. Caminito, √≠cono del barrio y la ciudad, es un atractivo y colorido callej√≥n a orillas del Riachuelo. El reconocido artista pl√°stico Quinquela Mart√≠n hizo de estos grises parajes ribere√±os un lugar lleno de vida y color, convirti√©ndolo en una referencia internacional y uno de los 10 lugares m√°s fotografiados del mundo seg√∫n Google Maps. En la caminata se visitan lugares tales como el transbordador Nicol√°s Avellaneda, el Museo Benito Quinquela Mart√≠n, la Vuelta de Rocha, Caminito, Fundaci√≥n PROA, la Bombonera y el cuartel de bomberos voluntarios, entre otros.
