NA,Refunds up to 7 days before event,"Synthesis of the human Mind Our internal world drives our external world. Our ability to use our mind determines how well we can control our external realities. What you may not know is that our Minds have an identity. Creating an Identity of mind allows us to direct our external world intentionally. The language we use to run our lives is one dimensional, which creates needless limitations. Our minds work best in a multidimensional language. Learning how to access your minds resources correctly will enable you to create a life beyond who we desire to be. Our vocabulary, are words we use internally to motivate change, but instead of encouraging us, the imperfections in our speech and articulation restrict access to our minds. There is no synchronicity between the one-dimensional language in our speech and the 4 th dimension of the mind. If you’re not using the correct language of the mind, the mind disengages where we become confused. We don’t have the language to describe the life that we want in a way that the mind accepts, understands, and can utilise. Mind ReMapping is a language illuminating an internal identity, so that we no longer need to be afraid of the dark, neither do we need to be afraid of our minds and what the future holds for us.

Sant Pau es el conjunto modernista más grande del mundo (ocupa aproximadamente 9 manzanas) y, también, la obra más importante del arquitecto modernista Lluís Domènech i Montaner. El Recinte Modernista de Sant Pau nació del trabajo visionario del arquitecto Domènech i Montaner. A principio de los años 1900, imaginó un hospital que ayudaría no solamente a currar físicamente los pacientes pero también sus mentes. Vio la necesidad de crear un ambiente alegre e inspirador. Declarado Patrimonio Mundial por la UNESCO el año 1997, por su singularidad y belleza artística, el Recinto Modernista está configurado como un conjunto arquitectónico formado por 12 pabellones rodeados de espacios verdes y conectados por un kilómetro de galerías subterráneas. Mosaicos, cúpulas, líneas alegres y azulejos policromados caracterizan ese edificio único. También puedes descubrir los túneles subterráneos que conectan cada edificio. En la visita al recinto, comenzarás por la Sala Hipóstila, que acogía las antiguas urgencias del Hospital. A través de los túneles, llegaréis al Pabellón de Sant Salvador, el primer edificio que entró en funcionamiento el 1916. Allá podéis recorrer la historia del antiguo Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau y conocer la obra y la trayectoria de Lluís Domènech i Montaner. La visita continua en los jardines. Paseando entre flores y plantas comprobaréis como la naturaleza fue fuente de inspiración modernista y herramienta fundamental para la curación de los enfermos. ¿Cómo era la vida en este entorno hospitalario en los años veinte del siglo pasado? Y en la ciudad de Barcelona, ¿qué medicina se practicaba? Lo descubriréis visitando la Casa de y el Pabellón de Sant Rafael, que acoge una recreación histórica y la exposición Operaciones ‘Paciente y médico, de la narración a la objetividad’. El recorrido acaba en el Pabellón de la Administración, el edificio más destacado de todo el conjunto.

2 hours,NA,"Los impactos de las crisis ecosociales son cada vez más evidentes. Fenómenos como la prolongada sequía, incendios de sexta generación, degradación de los suelos y pérdida de biodiversidad están teniendo consecuencias graves para la sociedad, y se espera que empeoren en el futuro. Frente a estos desafíos, los movimientos ecologistas señalan la falta de voluntad y acción política adecuada para hacer frente a estas crisis. Al mismo tiempo, encaran una creciente y preocupante represión a nivel nacional y europeo. En España, se han producido detenciones e imputaciones de activistas de colectivos ecologistas en los últimos meses, incluyendo a periodistas que cubrían las protestas. El Informe anual de la Fiscalía de 2023 mencionó el término ‘terrorismo’ en relación con grupos activistas como Rebelión o Extinción y Futuro Vegetal. Además, la retórica de la extrema derecha está contribuyendo a estigmatizar aún más el activismo ecologista, al retratarlo como ‘radical’ y ‘peligroso’. Estas tendencias también se observan en otros lugares de Europa; por ejemplo, en Francia, donde el movimiento Soulevements de la Terre (Levantamientos por la Tierra) enfrentó la ilegalización, aunque esta medida fue luego revocada. Estos acontecimientos subrayan la urgente necesidad de abordar la criminalización del activismo ecologista y explorar estrategias para proteger los derechos civiles. Por este motivo, el JHU-UPF Public Policy Center presenta el próximo Policy Dialogues: “Criminalización del movimiento ecologista en tiempos de crisis ecosocial”. En esta sesión, se explorará el tema desde diversas miradas y experiencias, incluyendo las del activismo, periodismo, derecho y política. Se buscará comprender las causas estructurales y políticas de la represión, así como sus implicaciones para la sociedad y la democracia. El panel contará con las siguientes ponentes: Mar Sala: Periodista audiovisual y comunicadora.

1 hora 30 minutos,NA,"La neurociencia ha logrado que implantar recuerdos o prótesis neuronales y la posibilidad de leer la mente ya no sean un asunto de ciencia ficción, y todo ello es abordado de forma minuciosa en Cosas que nunca creeríais: De la ciencia ficción a la neurociencia (Debate).  ***  «Quiero hablarles de la revolución que estamos viviendo en relación con el funcionamiento del cerebro. Una revolución tan profunda, tan cercana a las raíces de nuestra propia esencia, que se nutre de las discusiones más trascendentales de la filosofía y, a la vez, tan atrapante, que ha disparado la imaginación de escritores futuristas, siendo una fuente inagotable de infinidad de películas de ciencia ficción».  El prestigioso físico y neurocientífico Rodrigo Quian Quiroga, descubridor de las neuronas de concepto (también llamadas de Jennifer Aniston, porque responden a estímulos tan específicos como la imagen de la actriz) abre en Cosas que nunca creeríais las puertas a un viaje fantástico hacia cómo los avances en la neurociencia están materializando imaginarios antes reservados para las películas de ciencia ficción: desde borrar recuerdos hasta implantar prótesis neuronales o leer la mente.  Así, películas como Origen, Blade Runner, 2001: Odisea en el espacio o El planeta de los simios se convierten en un fértil campo de trabajo, no exento de importantes retos filosóficos, para las decenas de científicos que, como Quian Quiroga, trabajan diariamente para aproximar la fantasía a la realidad.  ***  Rodrigo Quian Quiroga es profesor ICREA en el Instituto de Investigación del Hospital del Mar en Barcelona.

Seguro que más de una vez se te pasó por la cabeza cantar en un coro y quizás el pánico escénico, el sentido del ridículo o la falta de decisión te han frenado; o tal vez ya hace mucho tiempo que cantas. Como director del coro Góspel Barcelona ¡te invito a experimentar y unirte a nuestro coro de Gospel singing choir! Somos un grupo de unas 20 personas que ensayamos todos los martes de 20 a 21:30h, en la calle Villarroel, 99. Muchos de ellos empezaron de cero y ahora ¡da gusto oírlos cantar! El ensayo está enfocado a todos los públicos, así que no te preocupes si hace tiempo que cantas o no lo has hecho jamás ¡Es mucho más sencillo de lo que imaginas! ¿Te apetece que te cuente cómo son nuestros ensayos? Empezamos con un masaje y clapping para relajar la musculatura y prepararnos para cantar. A continuación, calentamos con ejercicios de técnica vocal con los que cada semana podrás comprobar tus progresos y descubrir como la voz aprende a salir hacia fuera. El repertorio a cantar empieza siempre con temas nuevos y termina con canciones que ya conocemos, porque ¡nos gusta pasarlo bien! Y antes de que te vayas ¡te dedicaremos una canción! Y si además quieres conocer gente y hacer amigos, cuando acabe el ensayo puedes venirte a tomar algo con nosotros ¡Serás muy bienvenid@! El primer ensayo es GRATUITO y luego eliges que es lo que más te conviene: apuntarte un día a la semana, quizás dos, o incluso tres días! ¡Si te apetece acompañarnos, escríbeme! Te contaré todos los detalles y haremos una pequeña prueba de voz para encontrar tu lugar en el coro. Y si tienes curiosidad por ver quiénes somos, visita nuestra web ¡Así nos conocemos mejor!

Precio de los ensayos: 45€ al mes un ensayo a la semana Hello, I'm Josep Domenech! I'm sure that more than once you've thought about singing in a choir and perhaps stage fright, a sense of ridicule or lack of determination have held you back or maybe you have been singing for a while. As the director of the Barcelona Gospel Choir, I invite you to experiment and join our fun singing choir boleros and rock! We are a group of about 20 people who rehearse every tuesday from 20 to 21:30 h at 99 Villarroel Street. Many of them started from zero, and now it's great to hear them sing! The rehearsal is for everyone, so don't worry if you haven't sung for a long time or have sung for a long time. It's much easier than you think! Would you like me to tell you what our rehearsals are like? We start with a massage and clapping to relax the muscles and get ready to sing. Then we warm up with vocal technique exercises which you can use every week to check your progress and discover how your voice flows. The repertoire to sing always starts with new songs and ends with others we already know, because we like to have fun! And before you leave, we'll dedicate a song to you! And if you also want to meet people and make friends, when the rehearsal is over you can come and have a drink with us. You will be very welcome! The first rehearsal is FREE and then you can choose what suits you best: sign up for one day a week, maybe two, or even three days! If you feel like joining us, write to me! I'll tell you all the details and we'll do a little voice test to find your place in the choir. And if you're curious to see who we are, visit our website so we can get to know each other better!

NA,NA,"Uranus Comedy is a weekly stand up comedy show in English. Your regular host Andy Casper presents four experienced comedians over the course of an hour and a half with a break in the middle.  The comedians are either the best that the exciting Barcelona scene has to offer or professionals from overseas who are passing through the city.  In the past our stage has been graced by Netflix's Michelle Wolf, America's Got Talent's Preacher Lawson, and Amazon Prime Video's Sam Rhodes. The bar Space Cowboy is nestled in the heart of El Born, one of Barcelona's most vibrant neighbourhoods.  It's space themed murals and ''out there'' interior design provide a unique context for the show.

NA,NA,"Descubre la magnifica ciudad de Tarragona con este free tour que será un verdadero viaje en el tiempo. ¡Visita los vestigios arqueológicos que aún se conservan de Tarraco y conoce por qué fueron declarados Patrimonio de la Humanidad! Comenzaremos la visita divisando los restos de la antigua muralla romana y adentrándonos por el famoso Portal del Roser.  ¿Sabías que el centro histórico de Tarragona se asienta sobre la acrópolis de la ciudad clásica? La Catedral de Santa Tecla puede estar ubicada sobre un tempo a Augusto. ¡Es un verdadero ejemplo del gótico catalán! Durante nuestro recorrido podremos advertir los restos del foro provincial y el circo de época romana, pero también los templos, hospitales y casas de origen medieval.  Sabemos poco sobe la presencia musulmana en la ciudad, pero sí se conservan restos de la judería. Tras caminar junto a la Torre del Pretorio saldremos del recinto amurallado y llegaremos hasta el Balcón Mediterráneo. ¡Un lugar donde tomar unas fotos preciosas junto al mar! Finalizaremos la ruta conociendo el anfiteatro romano, donde se celebraban las luchas de gladiadores y ejecuciones públicas. ¿Qué te parece? ¡Reserva ya tu free tour por la Tarragona arqueológica!",0,0,EUR,Arkeo Tour,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-12T11:00:00Z,2024-03-12T13:00:00Z,Free tour por la Tarragona arqueológica,¡Descubre increíble pasado de Tarragona de la mano de un arqueólogo!,https://www.eventbrite.es/e/entradas-free-tour-por-la-tarragona-arqueologica-607615774137,barcelona,Sold out
