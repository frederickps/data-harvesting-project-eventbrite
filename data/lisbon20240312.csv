Come for dinner or a natural wine, stay for the conversation and new friendships. Miri thinks she has got her wife back, when Leah finally returns after a deep-sea mission that ended in catastrophe. It soon becomes clear, though, that Leah is not the same. Whatever happened in that vessel, whatever it was they were supposed to be studying before they were stranded on the ocean floor, Leah has brought part of it back with her, onto dry land and into their home. Moving through something that only resembles normal life, Miri comes to realize that the life that they had before might be gone. Though Leah is still there, Miri can feel the woman she loves slipping from her grasp. Our Wives Under The Sea is the debut novel from Julia Armfield, the critically acclaimed author of Salt Slow. It’s a story of falling in love, loss, grief, and what life there is in the deep deep sea. This book can be purchased at Fable.

What you may not know is that our Minds have an identity. Creating an Identity of mind allows us to direct our external world intentionally. The language we use to run our lives is one dimensional, which creates needless limitations. Our minds work best in a multidimensional language. Learning how to access your minds resources correctly will enable you to create a life beyond who we desire to be. Our vocabulary, are words we use internally to motivate change, but instead of encouraging us, the imperfections in our speech and articulation restrict access to our minds. There is no synchronicity between the one-dimensional language in our speech and the 4 th dimension of the mind. If you’re not using the correct language of the mind, the mind disengages where we become confused. We don’t have the language to describe the life that we want in a way that the mind accepts, understands, and can utilise.

1 hour,NA,"Abstract: The transition from COMET to XCOMET marks a significant evolution in machine translation evaluation methodologies. COMET, a neural framework renowned for its prowess in training multilingual machine translation evaluation models, has long been celebrated for its state-of-the-art correlation with human judgments. Leveraging breakthroughs in cross-lingual pretrained language modeling, COMET excels in generating adaptable evaluation models capable of accurately predicting translation quality by assimilating information from both source input and target-language references. However, the landscape of machine translation evaluation is rapidly evolving, propelled by the emergence of generative large language models (LLMs) and the demand for more granular error analysis. In response to these challenges, XCOMET emerges as a groundbreaking solution, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional learned metrics and the evolving demands of the field. Unlike its predecessor, XCOMET integrates both sentence-level evaluation and error span detection capabilities, offering deeper insights into translation errors and their severity. In this presentation, we delve into the conceptualization and implementation of XCOMET, highlighting its novel features and advancements over COMET. By combining state-of-the-art sentence-level evaluation with error span detection, XCOMET enriches the quality assessment process, providing valuable insights into the nature and severity of translation errors. Through rigorous analysis and stress tests, we showcase the robustness of XCOMET in identifying critical errors and hallucinations, solidifying its position as a pioneering solution in the realm of machine translation evaluation. Bio: Ricardo Rei is a senior research scientist at Unbabel, specializing in machine translation and natural language processing. He is set to complete his Ph.D. in April, which has been a collaborative effort between Unbabel, INESC-ID/Tecnico, and CMU University. His doctoral research has been centered on machine translation evaluation, and he is the main developer behind the COMET evaluation framework, which has become the industry standard metric for assessing machine translation quality. With a keen interest in advancing the capabilities of multilingual large language models (LLMs), he has been at the forefront of research and development in this domain. When not immersed in research, Ricardo enjoys maintaining an active lifestyle, often found at the gym or riding the waves while surfing—a passion he has pursued since the age of nine. www.priberam.com",0,0,EUR,Priberam Labs,https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-12T13:00:00Z,2024-03-12T14:00:00Z,Transparent MT Evaluation through Fine-grained Error Detection,Priberam Machine Learning Lunch Seminar,https://www.eventbrite.pt/e/transparent-mt-evaluation-through-fine-grained-error-detection-tickets-851434903717,lisbon,NA

It sits in one of Lisbon hills (the city is known for its 7 hills), with the castle sitting on top with a privileged view of the city and the Tagus river. There is no better place to feel the old city vibe than in Alfama. Part of its charm is actually its apparent degradation, intricate streets and the sound of fado music in every corner.
