Your donations help sustain our mission. “If only people would give meditation a real try, they'd experience directly for themselves how it's an absolute game-changer in life and in career. After all, many of the most successful people on the planet, from athletes to CEOs, meditate regularly. Then, there are all of the MRI studies that show how the brain becomes neuro-plastic, which means it physically changes toward balance and happiness with short amounts of daily meditation. What the ancients have known for millennia is now clearly proven in our modern science. And happy people are more engaged in their work."" ~ Chitananda - Learn how to enjoy a long, successful career - no burn-out - Overcome negative thoughts that keep you from realizing your full potential in career - Take your current career to a whole new level, or reinvent your career completely - Learn to balance power with humility... as you grow, you deepen into your own heart - Discover a very unique style of meditation that gives power to your career for years to come ----------------------- After signing up, you will receive a confirmation email from Eventbrite.

Chitananda has also studied Buddhism, in a heart-centered tradition, for over 19 years. He has applied these ancient teachings to many arenas in life, including athletics, academics, family life, and career. As Chitananda teaches it, Buddhism is a psychology that leads the practitioner to peace, balance, happiness, and success in all of life’s pursuits. ""The ancient Buddhist and Yoga texts have been applied to farm life, monastery life, and family life for millennia. The same teachings are still perfectly relevant to our everyday lives in this tech-driven world with all of its beautiful complexity. In this world, the home office becomes our monastery, our work becomes our offering to humanity, our family life becomes a playground to practice compassion and balance. You see? We are in the perfect time and place to practice the ancient teachings and rise to new heights, both within our minds and in career!"" ~ Chitananda This class is free for all. Chitananda's guiding purpose in life is to bring happiness and balance to as many people in this life as he can. He never wants money to get in the way of a student learning the inner arts.
