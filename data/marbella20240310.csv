Our ability to use our mind determines how well we can control our external realities. What you may not know is that our Minds have an identity. Creating an Identity of mind allows us to direct our external world intentionally. The language we use to run our lives is one dimensional, which creates needless limitations. Our minds work best in a multidimensional language. Learning how to access your minds resources correctly will enable you to create a life beyond who we desire to be. Our vocabulary, are words we use internally to motivate change, but instead of encouraging us, the imperfections in our speech and articulation restrict access to our minds. There is no synchronicity between the one-dimensional language in our speech and the 4 th dimension of the mind. If you’re not using the correct language of the mind, the mind disengages where we become confused. We don’t have the language to describe the life that we want in a way that the mind accepts, understands, and can utilise. Mind ReMapping is a language illuminating an internal identity, so that we no longer need to be afraid of the dark, neither do we need to be afraid of our minds and what the future holds for us.

On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge.

Our ability to use our mind determines how well we can control our external realities. What you may not know is that our Minds have an identity. Creating an Identity of mind allows us to direct our external world intentionally. The language we use to run our lives is one dimensional, which creates needless limitations. Our minds work best in a multidimensional language. Learning how to access your minds resources correctly will enable you to create a life beyond who we desire to be. Our vocabulary, are words we use internally to motivate change, but instead of encouraging us, the imperfections in our speech and articulation restrict access to our minds. There is no synchronicity between the one-dimensional language in our speech and the 4 th dimension of the mind. If you’re not using the correct language of the mind, the mind disengages where we become confused. We don’t have the language to describe the life that we want in a way that the mind accepts, understands, and can utilise.

NA,Sold out,Refunds up to 30 days before event,"Did you know, ""Not All Millennials are like that!""? As a leadership coach, I've coached and trained 4 different types of Millennials... On a scale from 1 to 10, just exactly how frustrated are you, when it comes to managing millennials on your team? 11? or maybe 12? I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone. But you have a long history of expanding your comfort zone, right? You are not the sort of person who spends 100% of their intellectual, mental and emotional energy fighting to stay inside their comfort zone, are you? The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials? And most importantly, you will learn how to establish a whole new narrative, how to present and control a new frame, so instead of you having to constantly appease, supplicate, pamper, and seeking approval from your bad employees with bad attitudes, you have the opposite: This class is ONLY for those managers who want to expand their own comfort zones, hear the truth, willing to do what has to be done, and want to overcome this challenge. You are busy, that's why this class is ""On-demand""! As soon as you register, you'll be able to take the class!

Your business competitors are not only working on stealing your customers away from you, they are also working on stealing your best employees from you. You are competing against other employers to attract and keep high quality employees. And your best employees? In this knowledge based economy, best employees know the key to their own long term well-being is their own skill set. They are hungry for knowledge, for wisdom, they want what's in your head, and they want you to make their learning experience inspirational not painful.

La Casa de la Contratación de Indias, establecida en Sevilla en 1503 por Isabel la Católica para fomentar y regular el comercio y la navegación con los territorios españoles en Ultramar,  hace que Sevilla obtenga el  monopolio con el Nuevo Mundo. Atraidos por esos barcos que van y vienen del Puerto de Sevilla, los comerciantes abarrotan la ciudad realizando negocios con los productos llegados del Nuevo Mundo.

Our minds work best in a multidimensional language. Learning how to access your minds resources correctly will enable you to create a life beyond who we desire to be.

O﻿ne of the most important roles in a Flamenco performance is that of a Palmero (the hand clapper). YES, you heard correctly! You won't ever see a flamenco show without one or two people in the back clapping their hands. What they are doing is called making Compás, or in other words, controlling the rhythm of the dance so that the singer, guitar player, and dancer are all on the same page. This important role sounds easy, but there is an art to clapping your hands in Flamenco, and that's exactly what you will learn in this workshop. Ever wonder what's happening when you watch a live Flamenco performance? Most Flamenco Tablaos are improvised, which is the beauty of this ancient art form. In this workshop, you'll learn Flamenco Compás  and Palmas (rhythm and clapping). Once you have the basics of rhythm, we'll show you some codes between musicians, dancers, and palmeros that happen during a live Tablao and put it to the test with a flamenco dancer and a flamenco guitar player!

Descubriendo San Luis con una mirada diferente. La iglesia nos servirá para conocer los principios básicos de la arquitectura barroca, y desentrañaremos el simbolismo y los secretos más cusiosos de este lugar. Será aquí donde ayudados de nuestros espejos, de los brillos y reflejos jugaremos con la visión indirecta de algunas de las piezas, de los retablos, y de algunos cuadros para descubrir lo cambiante y la riqueza del espacio barroco, incitando al visitante a mirar más allá. En la iglesia conoceremos algunas historias muy curiosas de personajes relacinados con ella: ¿Qué santo adivinó el día de su propia muerte? ¿Quién, tras ver un cadáver de una reina, cambiará por completo su vida? ¿Qué mujer sufragó algunos de los retablos de la Iglesia? o ¿Por qué fueron expulsados los Jesuitas de España? La cripta será el lugar perfecto para descubrir los restos arqueológicos  que en ella se conservan y que nos ayudarán a comprender mejor el proceso constructivo del templo.  La cripta se convertirá en el lugar perfecto para la reflexión personal, mirándonos en nuestros espejos iremos escuchando algunos fragmentos de literatura barroca que nos llevará na entender el espítu de Vanitas, vanitatis et omnia vanitas. En la capilla doméstica nos adentraremos en la vida cotidiana, en los usos y costumbres de un noviciado jesuíta. Nos trasladaremos al día a día de los que aquí vivieron y descubriremos su modo de entender la religiosidad, el amor a las reliquias y el culto a los huesos descubriendo algunas reliquias de las más de 300 que se conservan en este edificio.

NA,Sold out,Contacta con el organizador para solicitar un reembolso.,"El Monasterio de San Isidoro del Campo es una joya medieval que cuenta en su interior con lugares cargados de historias. De hecho, la leyenda cuenta que bajo el monasterio se encontraba un colegio fundado por San Isidoro y, sobre este, una ermita mozárabe que albergaba los restos del santo.
 Fue fundado por Guzmán el Bueno en 1301 como panteón familiar y hoy en día sigue sirviendo para el enterramiento de su linaje, siendo la última tumba de 2017. El monasterio fue dado por Guzmán el Bueno a los Cistercienses para que estos rezaran por su alma, y estuvieron unos cien años, hasta que fueron remplazados por los Jerónimos ermitaños de López de Olmedo. Esta orden fue la encargada de decorar pictóricamente el monasterio, ya que los cistercienses eran una orden tan austera que solo contaban con un cristo crucificado como decoración. Fue un importante foco de protestantismo y varios monjes tuvieron que huir porque fueron perseguidos por la Santa Inquisición, ya que estaban leyendo y traduciendo libros prohibidos, como la Biblia del Oso. Fue entonces cuando el rey Felipe II expulsó a esta orden y dio el monasterio a los Jerónimos que estuvieron hasta su desamortización.
 En el siglo XIX se dedicó entre otras cosas a fábrica de malta y a cárcel de mujeres, por lo cual el monasterio sufrió importantes deterioros, pero, tras la restauración de 2002, volvió a abrir sus puertas para que todos podamos disfrutar de las joyas que hay en su interior, como el retablo de Martínez Montañés, considerándose su San Jerónimo la obra cumbre de su producción.

I am sorry: For your current employees who are millennials: You need to do/learn/hear what is necessary! And what you need to hear (not what you want to hear) are outside of your current awareness, they are outside of your current comfort zone.

The type of person who insists on only hearing what they want to hear, and refuses to hear what they need to hear?  What do we call that kind of a person? A ""Millennial""? :-) How did this happen? And what can you do to solve your challenge? 1. Exactly what is the pack of lies that were told to millennials; (No, it's not what you think.) 2. Who told this pack of lies, and what were their motives; (No, it's not who you think, and it's not what you think.) 3. What is the truth that millennials need to hear. (No, it's not what you think.) 4. What is the truth that you need to hear? As we say in Chinese: ""Good medicine tastes bitter, honest advice sounds harsh to your ears."" You already know ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", but the truth will hurt your feelings first :-)  5. Why ""Appeasement"" is a really really bad policy, that will only turn you into an ""Enabler"", and harm everyone: your employees, the business, society at large and yourself. (Remember Neville Chamberlain and his disastrous policy of Appeasement?) 6. Why you must watch out for those who are trying to drive a wedge between employees and employers, or pit employees and employers against each other, instead of creating win/win situations for everyone. 7. How to figure out who need to be fired, and why you are actually harming them if you don't terminate them; 8. How to overcome your feeling of uneasiness to fire those who need to be fired, and why you are actually truly helping them by terminating them; 9. Who can be coached, and how to coach Millennials?

Se creó en el 206 a.C. como lugar de asentamiento de los veteranos romanos tras ganar la segunda Guerra Púnica contra los cartagineses, vencidos por las tropas de Scipión el Africano. Tan buenas fueron las circunstancias que rodearon a esta provisional ciudad que muchos de los soldados decidieron quedarse aquí, fundando Itálica. Se sucedieron buenos tiempos hasta llegar al nacimiento de los emperadores béticos: Trajano y Adriano, los cuales dieron a la ciudad gran esplendor. Creó entonces una gran ciudad de descanso con grandes domus e importantes edificios públicos, como las termas mayores y el Anfiteatro que, tras los últimos estudios, se sabe que es el segundo más grande del Imperio Romano, solo detrás del gran Coliseo en Roma. Y fue justo aquí, en este anfiteatro donde Juego de Tronos decidió rodar algunas de sus escenas de las temporadas 7 y 8. Como ves, es un lugar con mucho interés histórico y es perfecto para venir toda la familia, ya que cuenta con zonas de merenderos donde descansar tras la visita.",11.32,11.32,EUR,Mari Paz González (Margonvaztour Sevilla),https://schema.org/EventScheduled,2024-03-10T09:00:00Z,2024-03-10T10:30:00Z,"Visita guiada Itálica, ciudad de emperadores",La ciudad de Itálica nos invita a conocer cómo vivieron los grandes patricios y la sociedad de una gran ciudad romana.,https://www.eventbrite.es/e/entradas-visita-guiada-italica-ciudad-de-emperadores-721452914087,marbella
