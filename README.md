 > By Frederick PeÃ±a Sims & Eric Hausken-Brates

## Step 1: Get familiar with Eventbrite url & html 

The Eventbrite url is formatted so that you can select the city you want. You can also select the date of events and page number. Some cities have over 100 pages of events, with each page having 20 events.

## Step 2: write all the code 

### Start with Madrid 
Scrape the html code for the Madrid page:

```
link = https://www.eventbrite.es/d/spain--madrid/events--tomorrow/?page=1
html = link |> read_html()
```

Searching through this page, pull the url links for each event (up to 20 per page).
