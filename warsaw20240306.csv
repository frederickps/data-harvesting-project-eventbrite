7 hours 30 minutes,Mobile eTicket,No Refunds,"Reklama na Amazon jest skutecznym narzędziem zdobywania zamówień na oferowane na Amazonie produkty. Amazon wyświetla klientom produkty sponsorowane niemalże na każdym ekranie.  Dzięki płatnej reklamie produkty mogą szybko uzyskać pierwsze zamówienia a następnie stale się sprzedawać. U wielu sprzedawców na Amazonie reklama generuje nawet więcej niż połowę całej sprzedaży. Reklama ta kosztuje i to sporo. Płaci się za każde kliknięcie w produkt, niezależnie od tego czy klient kupi czy nie. Dlatego sumaryczny koszt reklamy na Amazonie wynosi najczęściej kilkadziesiąt procent wartości sprzedaży. U wielu sprzedawców wskaźnik jest tak wysoki, że cała sprzedaż jest kompletnie nieopłacalna a budżet reklamowy jest “przepalany” czyli marnowany. Wiedząc dlaczego budżet reklamowy wydawany jest na zbyt wiele wyświetleń reklamy, która nie przynosi zamówień, można w łatwy sposób polepszyć, zoptymalizować istniejące kampanie reklamowe. Koszt reklamy spada do założonego poziomu, zapewniając zyskowną sprzedaż. Przyjemnym efektem jest zazwyczaj wzrost sprzedaży, nie tylko tej generowanej przez płatną reklamę. W czasie szkolenia “Amazon Reklama PPC - dla sprzedawców” poznasz wszystkie zasady działania reklamy na Amazonie, uzyskasz wiedzę i umiejętności do sprawnego prowadzenia kampanii reklamowych. Przejmiesz pełną kontrolę nad wydatkami na reklamę, wpłyniesz na zwiększenie sprzedaży, znajomości produktów i rozpoznawania Twojej marki. Prowadzone jest przez wieloletniego sprzedawcę (od 2009 roku) i eksperta sprzedaży na Amazon. Łukasz Koronczok od wielu lat doradza sprzedawcom w Niemczech, Polsce, Szwajcarii i innych krajach. Jest praktykiem, który sam aktywnie sprzedaje na Amazonie i prowadzi skuteczne kampanie reklamowe. Równocześnie eksperymentuje z różnymi metodami marketingowymi, aby znaleźć oryginalne rozwiązania, które sprawdzą się w przypadku jego klientów. Jego agencja NetAnaliza używa sprawdzonych najlepszych praktyk, aby tworzyć reklamy na każdym poziomie budżetu - od 500 dolarów aż po 50 tysięcy euro miesięcznie! Całość szkolenia odbywa się w jeden dzień szkoleniowy w wygodnej i nowoczesnej sali. Przerwy pomagają w skutecznym przyswajaniu materiału i zapewniają przyjemną atmosferę. Na obiad zaprasza gospodarz spotkania Łukasz Koronczok.  Bardzo wskazane jest przywieźć własny laptop na warsztaty - uczestnicy dokonują od razu ustawień, zmian na własnych kontach Seller Central Amazon.
